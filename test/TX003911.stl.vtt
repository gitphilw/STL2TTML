Hmm.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.600 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The whole world watched...
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
..as three brave chimps boldly went
where no man had gone before.

(SCREAMS)

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.960 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They flew through a wormhole

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.240 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and were the first to discover life
on another planet.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
That planet is called Malgor.

(FUNKY MUSIC)

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They even brought back
a strange relic of alien life

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
on the nose cone of their rocket.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And that freznar-encased tyrant
of planet Malgor

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
was called Zartog.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Wahhhh! Ahhh!

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
ALL: Huh?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
ALL: Ooh!

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.360 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The world celebrated
these space chimp heroes

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
in newspapers...

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They've always been my heroes

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and I'm the tech whiz
who helped pilot them home.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They say everybody has their moment.
And it's finally my moment.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
My name's Comet

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and I am the new recruit on the next
'Return to Malgor' mission.

Hi, Comet! What's up?
Hey, Kilowatt!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.880 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Greetings from the cockpit
of the 'Horizon'.

Have you heard anything yet?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.720 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
No, but they will be posting
the launch date any time now.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Well, I hope it's soon.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I mean, our video chats are great

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
but I could really use a friend
to hang out with.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.160 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I know. Me too.
It's just a matter of time.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Planet Malgor, here I come.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.720 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%

Titan, here's your morning
power drink.

You need a spotter?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
OK. I'm here if you need me.

Gotta be in tip-top shape
for the mission.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.560 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They haven't announced
who's going yet, right?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Hey, I know who's going
to Malgor - me!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
See ya.

Huh? Oh.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Hey, do you have time to quiz me?
Hmm.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I see you're busy. Maybe later.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.240 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Look! It's the presidential
helicopter!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Thanks for the lift, guys.

If the President
wants to shoot hoops again,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.680 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
just have him call
my personal assistant!

Hey, Ham, welcome back.

How was your trip?

Thank you.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.440 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
So, personal assistant, how's
Hammie's afternoon looking today?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.280 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Let's see.
You've got two commercials.

Uh-huh.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.560 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%

'Stupid Pet Tricks' with Dave Leno.

results of yesterday's photoshoot.

Love it!

to smell like you.

'Cause, remember,
you promised to show me

I gotta prep for my interview.

by you, baby.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.560 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
could I, uh...get
a little personal assistance here?

What will the chimps'
next mission be?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.640 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The best way to fully understand
where we are

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
is to inhabit somewhere else.

Oh. Oh, my!

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.520 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%

they actually came through

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
with the all-you-can-eat sundae bar?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Mmm. Delicious.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Oh! I adore rainbow sprinkles!

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.000 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I calculate that my sundae
has over 4,000 rainbow sprinkles.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You know, I did my graduate
dissertation on ice-cream

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and the resultant brain freeze.

Hey, Comet. You in there?

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Say, how's that
new BananaBerry coming along?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's the bomb. I upgraded it to 3.0.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.280 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I added a touch screen,
solar batteries, GPS,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
traffic updates, SMS and video chat.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
O...K.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.200 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Don't know what that means,
but nicely done, kiddo.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.920 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Just reading e-mails

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
for the 'Return to Malgor' mission.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Man, I can't wait to go.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.960 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Huh? No!

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.960 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
No way! That's impossible!
What?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.840 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's the flight manifest
for the Malgor mission

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and my name has been crossed out.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Are you sure?
Look, it says it right here.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I got cut!

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I know it's hard, kid,
but you got a big job here.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You're our tech genius.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.880 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Remember, there can't be a mission
without Mission Control.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But I so wanted to go to Malgor
and see Kilowatt.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.200 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's not fair, Houston.
I trained, I helped everyone.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.360 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But no-one thinks
I'm part of the team

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
even though it's all I ever wanted.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I don't know what to say, kid.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.960 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Please, don't call me 'kid'.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.160 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'm sorry, Houston.
I...I need to be alone.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.240 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%

Brrrrrrr-rrrrrrr! (GIGGLES)

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.640 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Hey, Kilowatt.
What's wrong?

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.840 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'm not going to Malgor.
I got cut from the mission.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But...but then
I'll never get to meet you

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and show you around.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I know. They don't seem to need me.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.520 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I would give anything
if you could be here.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.320 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'd give anything too. But let's
face it, I'm not going anywhere.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.760 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Check ya later, Kilowatt.

I'd just forget everything anyway.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Besides, I don't need to study.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.960 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I have you.
Oh, you do, do you?

Ohh! Mm-hm.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And you'll do the studying

Houston. What up, monkey dog?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.720 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Comet took off.
Yeah, I know.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I sent him to the store for a bottle

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.680 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
No, Ham. He took off.
Like, in a rocket.

BOTH: What?!

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.640 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Wait, wait.
A rocket or a 'rocket' rocket?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.960 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
He's by himself in a rocket
and he's heading for the hypertunnel.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.520 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
He's not qualified.
He could get hurt. He could...

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.920 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I know. He was upset he got cut
from the Malgor mission.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
He tried to talk to me about it,
but I guess I didn't listen.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Maybe I didn't listen either.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.840 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Look, we gotta talk him down
before he hits the hypertunnel.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.000 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Patch us through to Comet.
Wh-what? Who? Me?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.520 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%

feed through the auxiliary...

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Sorry, Luna, I'm no Comet.
You two better get back here.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.600 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I don't think he'll listen
to anyone but Ham now.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Just get here fast!

who let Zartog take over?

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.600 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yes, but if I hadn't
let Zartog take over,

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.720 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
then we wouldn't need
the aforementioned plan,

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.120 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
That is what I'm talkin' about!
He nailed it!

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
That was amazing. Nice job, Comet.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(CHUCKLES) Aw, shucks.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Earth. I can't believe we made it.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Heh.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Whoa!

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Oh.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Welcome home, space chimp.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Brrrrrrr-rrrrrrr!

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.640 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(GASPS)
Huh?

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I hate to break up
this strange reunion,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
but...Zartog's back.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Uh...oh...

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Kilowatt! Nooooo!

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Comet, remember the BananaBerry.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.160 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It worked on Malgor.
It will work here.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You're next. Any last requests?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yeah. I'd like to make a phone call.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Huh?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.040 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Please stop! Whoa!

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Whoa! Ahh!

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'm...feeling...funny!

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
No! Ahh!

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Whoa!

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(BOTH SHOUT IN SLOW-MO) Nooooo!

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yah!
Wait!

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I still have so much love to give.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Well, that takes care of Zartog.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.640 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And our best scientists
and half of Mission Control.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And my best friend.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Huh? Huh. Let me see that thing.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.960 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(BUTTONS BEEP)

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
According to Einstein's theory,

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
you can double the particle velocity,

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.800 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
inverting the acceleration
and reversing time.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Here goes nothin'.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(GASPS)

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.960 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Whoa!
Ohh!

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.440 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Uh.
Ooh!

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.240 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It worked!
You brought them all back!

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yeah. That's our boy.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Good work, buddy.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.680 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Now, that's what I call
a magic trick.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.120 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(JAGU'S VOICE) It seems
we've been re-particlised.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.000 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(BOB'S VOICE) Your voice
sounds very weird.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.920 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(SENATOR'S VOICE) Your voice
sounds weird too.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.760 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(KILOWATT'S VOICE)
Their voices are mixed up.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.080 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Brrrrrrr! I'm glad mine doesn't sound
like a girl's or something.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(GASPS) Oh, no!

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(SCREAMS)

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Comet, can you take care of this?

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.040 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Already on it.
(BUTTONS BEEP)

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(NORMAL VOICE) Testing, testing.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Oh. Now, that is more like it.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I think the chimps just saved us.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.880 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yes, and it appears
he has just returned

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.960 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
from a second trip to Malgor
with even more aliens.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.600 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You know, maybe the chimps
should be running

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the space agency instead of us.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.280 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
That would definitely free up
more time for romance.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And ballet dancing.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:34.240 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Testing. One, two.
Testing. Testing. OK.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Um, this project is officially...

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
..weird.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.000 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The ray gun thingy is cancelled,
alright? Just cancel it.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.280 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Just focus on
the terraforming mission

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and that's it, alright?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'm going to eat an ice-cream sundae.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Thank you. Goodbye.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Comet, you saved us. You're a hero.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Can I call you 'Captain Comet'?

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.360 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yeah! Who flew to Malgor and back
all by himself?

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.960 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You.
Well, not entirely.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.560 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I did have some help
from a very awesome co-pilot.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Brrrrrrrrrrrr!

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I kind of feel bad about Zartog.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Really? You want him back?

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yeah.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.680 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
His toad-like ugliness and maniacal
pursuit of global domination

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
was kind of entertaining.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.280 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(CHUCKLES)
Hmm.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Maybe a teensy-tiny bit.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.280 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
OK. A teensy-tiny bit of Zartog
comin' up.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(SQUEAKY VOICE) I am Zartog!

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Hear me...squeak?

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
What the heck?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(OTHERS LAUGH)

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Vengeance will be mine!

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(ALL LAUGH)

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(PANTS)

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yeow!

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Tonight...
Uh?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.640 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
..in a special benefit
to support the space agency

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and Save the Chimps Fund,

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
we have a very special surprise.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Ha! Ta-da!

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Ha!

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.040 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Introducing
the monkey with the most,

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the pimp chimp who's no wimp!

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Put your opposable thumbs together

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
for the one and only Comet!

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.320 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
"The pimp chimp who's no wimp."

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.120 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'll have to remember that.
(AUDIENCE CHANTS) Comet! Comet!

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Comet! Comet! Comet!

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(LAUGHS)

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
HAM: Now, because you demanded it,

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
it's time for Spin the Chimp!

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.560 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Hopefully, this chimp
won't toss his bananas.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.360 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(BOING!)
(GRUNTS)

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.440 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
Is it me or is this guy great?

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Here you go, kid.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Can I really?

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Oh! Thanks, Ham!

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Ready?

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Oh, yeah. I am so ready!

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.840 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Remember, Comet, keep your head up
and reach for the stars.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
No! Whoa! Uh!

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Huh?

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Ahh! (GROANS)

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(SQUEALS)

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.200 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Huh?
Nice poochie.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.400 line:76% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Nice poochie.
