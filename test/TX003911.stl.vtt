WEBVTT

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.560 line:12 align:middle
Hmm.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.600 line:11 align:middle
The whole world watched...
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.080 line:11 align:middle
..as three brave chimps boldly went
where no man had gone before.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.800 line:12 align:middle
(BOOM!)

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.960 line:12 align:middle
(SCREAMS)

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:01.960 line:12 align:middle
They flew through a wormhole

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240 line:11 align:middle
and were the first to discover life
on another planet.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.160 line:12 align:middle
That planet is called Malgor.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.640 line:12 align:middle
(FUNKY MUSIC)

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.800 line:11 align:middle
They even brought back
a strange relic of alien life

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.080 line:12 align:middle
on the nose cone of their rocket.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.800 line:11 align:middle
And that freznar-encased tyrant
of planet Malgor

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.080 line:12 align:middle
was called Zartog.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.160 line:12 align:middle
Wahhhh! Ahhh!

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.760 line:12 align:middle
ALL: Huh?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.000 line:12 align:middle
ALL: Ooh!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.360 line:11 align:middle
The world celebrated
these space chimp heroes

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000 line:12 align:middle
in newspapers...

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.000 line:11 align:middle
..TV...
(WILD CHEERING)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.640 line:12 align:middle
..and ticker tape parades.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.000 line:12 align:middle
They've always been my heroes

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.400 line:11 align:middle
and I'm the tech whiz
who helped pilot them home.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.080 line:11 align:middle
They say everybody has their moment.
And it's finally my moment.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.760 line:12 align:middle
My name's Comet

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:00.400 line:11 align:middle
and I am the new recruit on the next
'Return to Malgor' mission.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.760 line:12 align:middle
Computer, run systems diagnostics.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.320 line:12 align:middle
COMPUTER: Systems online.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.000 line:12 align:middle
Initiate pre-flight check.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.400 line:11 align:middle
Propellant.
Propellant, check.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.720 line:11 align:middle
Cellerons.
Cellerons, check.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.360 line:11 align:middle
Video feed.
Video feed to Malgor activated.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.840 line:11 align:middle
Hi, Comet! What's up?
Hey, Kilowatt!

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.880 line:11 align:middle
Greetings from the cockpit
of the 'Horizon'.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.480 line:11 align:middle
Oh, cool! You're in the ship.
Have you heard anything yet?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.720 line:11 align:middle
No, but they will be posting
the launch date any time now.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.240 line:12 align:middle
Well, I hope it's soon.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:03:30.160 line:12 align:middle
I mean, our video chats are great

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.080 line:11 align:middle
but I could really use a friend
to hang out with.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.160 line:11 align:middle
I know. Me too.
It's just a matter of time.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.200 line:12 align:middle
Planet Malgor, here I come.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.720 line:11 align:middle
Gotta jet.
Call you at our usual chat time.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.240 line:12 align:middle
OK. 'Bye, Comet!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.000 line:12 align:middle
Yeah!

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.160 line:12 align:middle
Wee! Whoo-hoo!

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.600 line:12 align:middle
Greetings, small, furry one.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.640 line:12 align:middle
I am Lord Zartog,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680 line:12 align:middle
conqueror of all conquerors,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.280 line:12 align:middle
ruler of all rulers.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.680 line:12 align:middle
Fear my wrath!

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.920 line:11 align:middle
(PEES)
(GRUNTS)

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.200 line:12 align:middle
Revenge will be mine!

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.320 line:12 align:middle
Watch your back, poochie.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:04:33.680 line:12 align:middle
333,486.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.160 line:12 align:middle
Ahh.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.320 line:12 align:middle
333,487.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320 line:12 align:middle
Ahh...

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.000 line:11 align:middle
Titan, here's your morning
power drink.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.520 line:12 align:middle
You need a spotter?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.920 line:12 align:middle
OK. I'm here if you need me.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.440 line:11 align:middle
Whew.
Houston.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.240 line:11 align:middle
One grade A banana,
just like you ordered.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.720 line:12 align:middle
Thanks, kid.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.280 line:11 align:middle
Gotta be in tip-top shape
for the mission.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.560 line:11 align:middle
They haven't announced
who's going yet, right?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:01.400 line:11 align:middle
Hey, I know who's going
to Malgor - me!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.480 line:12 align:middle
See ya.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.400 line:11 align:middle
Lieutenant Luna,
here's your mission report.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.960 line:12 align:middle
Huh? Oh.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.080 line:11 align:middle
Hey, do you have time to quiz me?
Hmm.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.640 line:12 align:middle
I see you're busy. Maybe later.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.240 line:11 align:middle
Look! It's the presidential
helicopter!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.720 line:12 align:middle
Thanks for the lift, guys.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.360 line:11 align:middle
If the President
wants to shoot hoops again,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:05:31.680 line:11 align:middle
just have him call
my personal assistant!

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.680 line:12 align:middle
Hey, Ham, welcome back.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.720 line:11 align:middle
How was your trip?
Comet, baby, my main monkey man!

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.400 line:12 align:middle
Trip was awesome!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.640 line:11 align:middle
Holdin' down the fort?
You know it, Captain.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.560 line:12 align:middle
(COUGHS) Dry.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.760 line:12 align:middle
Must have fruity drink.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.760 line:12 align:middle
Thank you.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.440 line:11 align:middle
So, personal assistant, how's
Hammie's afternoon looking today?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.280 line:11 align:middle
Let's see.
You've got two commercials.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.360 line:12 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.560 line:11 align:middle
Your 'E! Profile'.
Uh-huh.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.480 line:11 align:middle
And you're doing '60 Minutes'
and 'VHT Cribs'.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:01.840 line:12 align:middle
Love it.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.080 line:11 align:middle
And tonight you're guest-hosting
'Stupid Pet Tricks' with Dave Leno.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.560 line:12 align:middle
Eh... Love it.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.480 line:11 align:middle
Oh, also...
Yeah?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.400 line:11 align:middle
I thought you'd like to see the
results of yesterday's photoshoot.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.640 line:12 align:middle
Brokeback Monkey?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.520 line:11 align:middle
You're the new face
of Low Rider Jeans,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.440 line:12 align:middle
which is great PR for the agency.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.600 line:12 align:middle
(SLURPS) Ahh!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.160 line:12 align:middle
Yeah. Take a note.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.000 line:11 align:middle
No more Ham on horseback.
I think I bruised my butt.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.920 line:11 align:middle
You're the new sound of smooth jazz -
108.7, the 'Snooze'.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.400 line:12 align:middle
Oh. Nice hair.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.280 line:11 align:middle
You're on every box
of Chimpa Noodles.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:06:31.280 line:12 align:middle
(SINGS) # Chimpa Noodles, yeah! #

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.800 line:11 align:middle
And here's the new campaign
for Calvin Clone,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.360 line:12 align:middle
for their men's body wash.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.480 line:11 align:middle
Use Ham Body Wash
so you can smell...

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.960 line:11 align:middle
(INHALES DEEPLY) ..just like me.
Love it!

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.040 line:11 align:middle
Like anyone would want
to smell like you.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.480 line:12 align:middle
Shut...shut-ut-ut. I'm being famous.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.720 line:12 align:middle
Hmph.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.120 line:11 align:middle
Oh, you've got
your Katie Kellie interview.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.600 line:12 align:middle
But do you have some time now?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.080 line:11 align:middle
'Cause, remember,
you promised to show me

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.680 line:12 align:middle
how to get shot out of the cannon.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.400 line:11 align:middle
Yeah, sure. Later, kid. Right now,
I gotta prep for my interview.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.160 line:12 align:middle
Katie is just too cute to wait.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160 line:11 align:middle
Let me run a couple of things
by you, baby.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.760 line:11 align:middle
I figured I'd give her a bit of
this... (IMITATES ELECTRIC GUITAR)

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.800 line:11 align:middle
Wow! And then cap it off
with a little...

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.000 line:12 align:middle
Oww! Moonwalkin'! Moonwalkin'.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240 line:12 align:middle
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.200 line:12 align:middle
Huh! Pretty good, right?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.160 line:11 align:middle
Did you lose some brain cells
when we crash-landed?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.560 line:12 align:middle
Pssh! Wh-wh-wh-whoa!

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.920 line:12 align:middle
Umm...personal assistant,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.560 line:11 align:middle
could I, uh...get
a little personal assistance here?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.120 line:12 align:middle
Uh...

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.320 line:12 align:middle
Some day, that'll be me.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.240 line:12 align:middle
Whoa, whoa!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.840 line:11 align:middle
So we've redesigned the whole
space centre from top to bottom

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.280 line:12 align:middle
for our heroic astrochimps.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.920 line:12 align:middle
Now, there's a chimp Olympic pool,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:00.880 line:12 align:middle
there's a chimp massage centre,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.480 line:12 align:middle
a chimp jacuzzi,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.960 line:12 align:middle
a simian weight facility,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.280 line:12 align:middle
a chimp aromatherapy room,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.120 line:12 align:middle
the Future Monkey Meditation Centre.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.600 line:12 align:middle
(CHUCKLES)

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.000 line:11 align:middle
And we'll be upgrading
our heroic chimps' living quarters

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.160 line:12 align:middle
to five stars.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.600 line:11 align:middle
Isn't that wonderful?
REPORTERS: Senator! Excuse me!

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.480 line:11 align:middle
What will the chimps'
next mission be?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.640 line:11 align:middle
The best way to fully understand
where we are

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.200 line:12 align:middle
is to inhabit somewhere else.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.960 line:12 align:middle
Oh. Oh, my!

00:07:30.960 --> 00:08:32.520 line:11 align:middle
Can you believe
they actually came through

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.200 line:12 align:middle
with the all-you-can-eat sundae bar?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.800 line:12 align:middle
Mmm. Delicious.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.440 line:12 align:middle
Oh! I adore rainbow sprinkles!

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.000 line:11 align:middle
I calculate that my sundae
has over 4,000 rainbow sprinkles.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.800 line:11 align:middle
You know, I did my graduate
dissertation on ice-cream

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.160 line:12 align:middle
and the resultant brain freeze.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.880 line:12 align:middle
Hey, Comet. You in there?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.400 line:11 align:middle
Say, how's that
new BananaBerry coming along?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.400 line:12 align:middle
It's the bomb. I upgraded it to 3.0.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.280 line:11 align:middle
I added a touch screen,
solar batteries, GPS,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:02.080 line:12 align:middle
traffic updates, SMS and video chat.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.560 line:12 align:middle
O...K.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.200 line:11 align:middle
Don't know what that means,
but nicely done, kiddo.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.680 line:12 align:middle
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.920 line:11 align:middle
Just reading e-mails
to see if there's a launch date

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.400 line:12 align:middle
for the 'Return to Malgor' mission.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.880 line:12 align:middle
Man, I can't wait to go.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.960 line:12 align:middle
Huh? No!

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.960 line:11 align:middle
No way! That's impossible!
What?

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.840 line:11 align:middle
It's the flight manifest
for the Malgor mission

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.360 line:12 align:middle
and my name has been crossed out.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.400 line:11 align:middle
Are you sure?
Look, it says it right here.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:09:31.880 line:12 align:middle
I got cut!

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.080 line:11 align:middle
I know it's hard, kid,
but you got a big job here.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.680 line:12 align:middle
You're our tech genius.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.880 line:11 align:middle
Remember, there can't be a mission
without Mission Control.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.400 line:11 align:middle
But I so wanted to go to Malgor
and see Kilowatt.

It's not fair, Houston.
I trained, I helped everyone.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.360 line:11 align:middle
But no-one thinks
I'm part of the team

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.480 line:12 align:middle
even though it's all I ever wanted.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.640 line:12 align:middle
I don't know what to say, kid.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.960 line:12 align:middle
Please, don't call me 'kid'.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.160 line:11 align:middle
I'm sorry, Houston.
I...I need to be alone.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.240 line:11 align:middle
Hi, Comet!
Brrrrrrr-rrrrrrr! (GIGGLES)

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.640 line:11 align:middle
Hey, Kilowatt.
What's wrong?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.840 line:11 align:middle
I'm not going to Malgor.
I got cut from the mission.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.400 line:11 align:middle
But...but then
I'll never get to meet you

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.280 line:12 align:middle
and show you around.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.760 line:12 align:middle
I know. They don't seem to need me.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.520 line:11 align:middle
I would give anything
if you could be here.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:10:33.320 line:11 align:middle
I'd give anything too. But let's
face it, I'm not going anywhere.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.760 line:11 align:middle
Check ya later, Kilowatt.
Comet out.

Hey, where's the fire, little buddy?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.240 line:11 align:middle
It's about the mission.

on the trunnions again.

He's not qualified.
He could get hurt. He could...

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.920 line:11 align:middle
I know. He was upset he got cut
from the Malgor mission.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.800 line:11 align:middle
He tried to talk to me about it,
but I guess I didn't listen.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.400 line:12 align:middle
Maybe I didn't listen either.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.840 line:11 align:middle

Well, it's a de-particliser.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.320 line:11 align:middle

only de-particlises things.

Shouldn't the commander
technically come up with the plan?

The commander
who let Zartog take over?

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.600 line:11 align:middle
Yes, but if I hadn't
let Zartog take over,

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.720 line:11 align:middle
then we wouldn't need
the aforementioned plan,

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.080 line:12 align:middle
Vengeance will be mine!

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.840 line:12 align:middle

(PANTS)

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.320 line:12 align:middle
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.480 line:12 align:middle
Yeow!

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.400 line:11 align:middle
Tonight...
Uh?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.640 line:11 align:middle
..in a special benefit
to support the space agency

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.760 line:12 align:middle
and Save the Chimps Fund,

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.240 line:12 align:middle
we have a very special surprise.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.120 line:12 align:middle
Ha! Ta-da!

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.600 line:12 align:middle
Ha!

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.040 line:11 align:middle
Introducing
the monkey with the most,

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.320 line:12 align:middle
the pimp chimp who's no wimp!

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.680 line:12 align:middle
Put your opposable thumbs together

01:05:29.680 --> 01:06:32.680 line:12 align:middle
for the one and only Comet!

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.320 line:11 align:middle
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
"The pimp chimp who's no wimp."

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.120 line:11 align:middle
I'll have to remember that.
(AUDIENCE CHANTS) Comet! Comet!

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.400 line:12 align:middle
Comet! Comet! Comet!

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.400 line:12 align:middle
(LAUGHS)

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.440 line:12 align:middle
HAM: Now, because you demanded it,

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.520 line:12 align:middle
it's time for Spin the Chimp!

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.560 line:11 align:middle
Hopefully, this chimp
won't toss his bananas.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:06:00.360 line:11 align:middle
(BOING!)
(GRUNTS)

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.440 line:11 align:middle
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
Is it me or is this guy great?

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.840 line:12 align:middle
Here you go, kid.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.840 line:12 align:middle
Can I really?

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.240 line:12 align:middle
Oh! Thanks, Ham!

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.080 line:12 align:middle
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.360 line:12 align:middle
Ready?

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.680 line:12 align:middle
Oh, yeah. I am so ready!

01:06:29.680 --> 01:07:33.840 line:11 align:middle
Remember, Comet, keep your head up
and reach for the stars.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.600 line:12 align:middle
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.640 line:12 align:middle

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.720 line:12 align:middle
No! Whoa! Uh!

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.200 line:12 align:middle
Huh?

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.720 line:12 align:middle
Ahh! (GROANS)
