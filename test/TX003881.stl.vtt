Well, then you just knowingly
killed a $750,000 athlete.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.880 line:11 align:middle
We need to make a move.
PALMER: Tell me.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.400 line:12 align:middle
It's her cannon bone, Mr Palmer.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.920 line:11 align:middle
You pushed her.
She'd have run in the Breeders' Cup.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.400 line:12 align:middle
She was special!

00:13:27.480 --> 00:14:30.320 line:11 align:middle
And now she's got a broken leg
and it's over, so let it go.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.000 line:11 align:middle
You don't care about anybody,
do you? Horses or people.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.680 line:12 align:middle
Well, in fact, I do, Ben,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.520 line:11 align:middle
and that's why I'm giving you
the opportunity to find a new job.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.920 line:11 align:middle
Are you firing me?
That's right.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.560 line:12 align:middle
You can take your Mexicans with you.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.760 line:12 align:middle
They're men, Palmer. They got names.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.040 line:12 align:middle

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.720 line:11 align:middle
You'll get your cheque first of
the month, like everybody else.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:14:01.040 line:11 align:middle
No, you pay me now.
$9,000 for the last three months.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.360 line:12 align:middle
Here's $6,000. $6,000.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.840 line:11 align:middle
Take it or leave it.
I'll leave it. We agreed on $9,000.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.440 line:11 align:middle
You're $3,000 short.
You wait for a cheque.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.040 line:11 align:middle
I'm not waiting for a cheque!

PLEASE put that horse down!

(Snorts)

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.120 line:12 align:middle
I'll take the $6,000 and the horse.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.720 line:11 align:middle
$6,000 and a dead horse and
I never have to hear from you again?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.560 line:11 align:middle
That's right.
Take the money.

(Sonya whinnies)

00:14:28.240 --> 00:15:31.160 line:11 align:middle
Sedate her, Dan.
Put her down heavy for the night.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.800 line:11 align:middle
It'll cost you $400
just to dispose of her body.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.280 line:12 align:middle
Balon, hook up a trailer, would you?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.320 line:11 align:middle
You got a hard head, Ben,
just like your old man.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.400 line:11 align:middle
Cale, go on out to the truck.
On a horse farm with no horses.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.800 line:11 align:middle
Go on. Manny,
take her out to the truck.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.240 line:11 align:middle
Delusional. It's like a disease
with you Cranes.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.760 line:11 align:middle
Better get out of here
before it rubs off on her.

BEN: Manny!
Yeah?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.240 line:12 align:middle
Go get the old man.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.240 line:12 align:middle
Tell him it's an emergency.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.720 line:11 align:middle
Alright, Balon, we need
the heavy winch and the sling

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.200 line:12 align:middle
to get her in this stall.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.840 line:11 align:middle
BALON: OK, where's that?
It's in the back stall there.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.520 line:12 align:middle
BALON: Oh, OK. I got it.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.400 line:11 align:middle
Where have you been?
God, I've been so worried.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.560 line:11 align:middle
What's going on?
I had a horse go down.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:16:30.480 line:11 align:middle
Oh, my God.
OK, anything else, boss?

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.560 line:11 align:middle
Yeah, give Balon a hand back there,
will you?

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.760 line:11 align:middle
Manny.
Balon.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.080 line:11 align:middle
MAN: What would you geniuses
be calling an 'emergency'

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.720 line:12 align:middle
at night in the rain?

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.800 line:12 align:middle
This about a horse?

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.560 line:12 align:middle
Goodnight.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.200 line:12 align:middle
I never ask you for anything.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.960 line:11 align:middle
That's right.
I haven't heard from you in months.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:01.880 line:11 align:middle
That's why your business
is so great.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.120 line:11 align:middle
I got a filly in there
with a broken cannon bone, Pop.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.880 line:12 align:middle
Thoroughbred?

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.800 line:12 align:middle
Racer?

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.880 line:12 align:middle
Put her down.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.720 line:11 align:middle
You had a horse with
a shattered cannon bone once.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800 line:11 align:middle
You harnessed it up somehow
so it couldn't move.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.400 line:11 align:middle
The leg healed
and that horse was fine.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.680 line:12 align:middle
That was a long time ago.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:17:31.480 line:11 align:middle
You were just a little boy,
Benjamin.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.240 line:12 align:middle
But I remember it. It worked.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.560 line:12 align:middle
He was an old lead pony.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.600 line:11 align:middle
Healed just enough to walk around
for a few more years

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.520 line:12 align:middle
before I finally put him down.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.160 line:11 align:middle
Which is what you'd do
if you had any sense at all.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:00.680 line:12 align:middle
Let's get her in the stall.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.560 line:11 align:middle
Cale.
He wanted me to help them, Mom.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.600 line:11 align:middle
Cale, I'm gonna
spend the night with her.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.360 line:12 align:middle
You go on inside with Mom, now.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.480 line:11 align:middle
Alright.
Right up there?

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.280 line:11 align:middle
Yep. Alright.
Right, Manny?

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.080 line:11 align:middle
You got the big winch?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.520 line:12 align:middle
Let's hook it up. Come on.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.400 line:12 align:middle
(Exhales)

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.480 line:11 align:middle
DOC: Was it a hard fall?
Well, hard enough.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.640 line:11 align:middle
She didn't get bumped or anything.
She...she just went down.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.680 line:12 align:middle
That's the one from the track

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.520 line:12 align:middle
and my X-rays confirm it.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.000 line:11 align:middle
It's a spiral fracture
of the cannon bone.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:01.720 line:11 align:middle
But it is non-displaced.
She'll never race again?

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.520 line:12 align:middle
No, honey. But she might walk again.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.840 line:11 align:middle
There's a chance. It's up to her.
Try and keep her calm.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.560 line:11 align:middle
Stable rest.
That cast I put on her should hold.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.520 line:12 align:middle
I'll go real easy on her, Doc.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.200 line:11 align:middle

BEN: You got it.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.400 line:11 align:middle
Alright, let's pull
all the harness stuff.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.760 line:11 align:middle
Put the straps, the pulley
in the tack room.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.760 line:11 align:middle
Ben, when Mr Palmer fired you and us
yesterday, well...

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.880 line:12 align:middle
Well, we all don't have no jobs.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:19:30.000 line:12 align:middle
I'm sorry, guys. I forgot. Here.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.720 line:12 align:middle
Here's $1,000 each.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.480 line:12 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.680 line:12 align:middle
Well, we train racehorses, right?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.240 line:11 align:middle
And she's not gonna
race no more so...

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.760 line:12 align:middle
So why are we gonna hang around

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.720 line:11 align:middle
and help you get
a broken racehorse to walk?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.800 line:12 align:middle
You know who this horse was sired by?

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.240 line:12 align:middle
Dreamcatcher. You know who that was?

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.000 line:12 align:middle
Pop, who was Dreamcatcher?

00:19:59.480 --> 00:19:02.160 line:12 align:middle
Won the Dubai World Cup in '96.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.320 line:11 align:middle
Won seven of eleven Graded Stakes
and over $3 million.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.120 line:11 align:middle
We get her healed enough
to breed her to a decent stud,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.920 line:11 align:middle
sell that yearling for,
I dunno, maybe...

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.480 line:11 align:middle
If it's a colt with good
confirmation, maybe $300,000.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.400 line:12 align:middle
BEN: $300,000.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.560 line:11 align:middle

Pop said Dad's the best horseman.
Says he has a gift.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.840 line:12 align:middle
Well, that's true.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.480 line:12 align:middle
We all know that's true.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.960 line:11 align:middle
Hey.
Hello.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.800 line:12 align:middle
Whoa, Zephyr. Whoa, boy.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.760 line:12 align:middle
Thanks, Mike.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:26:32.600 line:11 align:middle
What did you think about that?
That was fast.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.880 line:11 align:middle
Nice boots.
Ah, thank you.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.520 line:11 align:middle
Just saddled a couple of horses
for a few owners.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.280 line:12 align:middle
(Sighs)

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.080 line:11 align:middle
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.600 line:12 align:middle
You ever ride in races?

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.120 line:12 align:middle
Couple of times I did.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:00.760 line:12 align:middle
But no more.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.280 line:12 align:middle
Why?

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.520 line:12 align:middle
Ah...

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.520 line:12 align:middle
..I have bad dreams.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.880 line:11 align:middle
Three years ago
I got my first real race.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.840 line:12 align:middle
I ran fifth.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.040 line:12 align:middle
What was the name of the horse?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.240 line:12 align:middle
Downtown Swing.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.920 line:12 align:middle
He was amazing.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.760 line:12 align:middle
Did you ever ride him again?

00:26:30.840 --> 00:27:33.760 line:11 align:middle
Yeah. In his second race
I was flying into that first turn.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.840 line:11 align:middle
Then I looked under my arm
to see if I was clear on the rail.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.120 line:11 align:middle
When I looked back up,
there was a horse swerving into me.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.520 line:11 align:middle
My left foot came outta the iron,
I fell to the ground

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.200 line:12 align:middle
and I got run over by three horses.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.560 line:12 align:middle
Broke both shoulders,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.360 line:12 align:middle
sternum,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.000 line:12 align:middle
four ribs,

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.520 line:12 align:middle
a punctured lung.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.760 line:12 align:middle
You never raced again?

00:27:59.360 --> 00:27:02.520 line:12 align:middle
(Sighs) 

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.920 line:11 align:middle
You know,
at night when I fall asleep...

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.400 line:11 align:middle
..I dream I'm in a big race
on a very fast horse.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.560 line:11 align:middle
I look to my left foot, it slips out
of the iron and I begin to fall.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.840 line:11 align:middle
But before I hit the ground,
I wake up.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.840 line:11 align:middle
But you still exercise racehorses.
Yeah.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.880 line:12 align:middle
It's just...

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.800 line:12 align:middle
..it's just me and the horse,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:28:31.600 line:12 align:middle
alone on the track, free,

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.680 line:12 align:middle
no-one to bother us.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.640 line:12 align:middle
It's much better that way.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.560 line:11 align:middle
I'm sorry about your nightmares,
Manny.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.080 line:12 align:middle
It's OK.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.880 line:11 align:middle
It's God's way of telling me
no more racing.

From Mom.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.080 line:12 align:middle
I'm good. Just put it down.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.880 line:12 align:middle
Cale.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.040 line:11 align:middle
Can you grab that roll of wire
underneath the fence there?

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.640 line:12 align:middle
Yeah.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:29:01.080 line:11 align:middle
Just hang onto it there.
OK.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.880 line:11 align:middle
Pop said
this farm used to be beautiful.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.480 line:12 align:middle
This farm WAS beautiful.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.680 line:11 align:middle
200 acres.
One of the nicest in Versailles.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.960 line:11 align:middle
See all that over there?
Yeah.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.920 line:12 align:middle
Well, that was ours.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:30:32.040 line:11 align:middle
Pop's owned
some really nice race mares.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.640 line:12 align:middle
Big, beautiful female horses.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.240 line:11 align:middle
Wave Land, Blue Jezebel
and Miss Muffet.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.000 line:12 align:middle
That's right.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.920 line:11 align:middle
Pop said he built those stalls
and filled them with horses.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.360 line:11 align:middle
Yeah, he made a good living
selling yearlings.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.040 line:11 align:middle
But you wanted to keep yearlings
and race them, right?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:00.560 line:12 align:middle
Well, it got kinda hard.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.000 line:12 align:middle
We had some horses born on this farm

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.920 line:11 align:middle
go on to win big races
for somebody else.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.960 line:11 align:middle
So you got Pop
to keep some of the yearlings

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.520 line:12 align:middle
so you could train 'em, race 'em?

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.760 line:11 align:middle
You don't just keep 'em, Cale.
They're not free.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.280 line:12 align:middle
I'm gonna brush down Sonya.

your creative writing assignment?

Yes, ma'am.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.280 line:12 align:middle
What's your story about?

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.880 line:12 align:middle
It's about a king

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.560 line:12 align:middle
in his castle.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.840 line:12 align:middle

Not for long...
but she can stand on it.

I'll run a couple more tests
in the morning, Ben,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.600 line:11 align:middle
but I don't see any reason
she can't breed - she looks good.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.280 line:11 align:middle
You helped her, Cale.
She's gonna have a baby! Yeah!

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.880 line:12 align:middle
I'll see you Friday.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.920 line:12 align:middle

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.880 line:12 align:middle
So where are you going?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.400 line:12 align:middle
Gonna go see an old friend.

to help me out here?

the $15,000 by the end of the week.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.080 line:12 align:middle
That's, ah...$15,000. Ah...

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.600 line:11 align:middle

are $200,000.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:36:30.480 line:11 align:middle
We're waiving that completely.
Yeah, I know, but...

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.840 line:11 align:middle
The $15,000 doesn't even cover
our costs and insurance.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.680 line:11 align:middle
No, Bill, it's an amazing offer.
I just didn't, you know, I-I...

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.800 line:11 align:middle
I'm wondering, though,
if maybe I couldn't, you know,

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.160 line:11 align:middle
give you a share in the foal
to cover all the expenses,

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.560 line:12 align:middle
whatever they are.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.320 line:12 align:middle

Not in a case like this.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.120 line:11 align:middle

you want to call it off?

No, it's...

I really appreciate you trying.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.280 line:12 align:middle
"..the way to victory.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.080 line:11 align:middle
"And I met my owner
in the winner's circle."

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.320 line:11 align:middle
"Where he put a blanket of flowers
on my back."

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.160 line:12 align:middle
(Laughs) You remembered that.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.800 line:12 align:middle
Sport of kings, you know that?

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.280 line:11 align:middle
They call horseracing
the sport of kings.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:01.600 line:11 align:middle
So when are you going to take me
to the races?

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.080 line:11 align:middle
I don't go anymore.
Haven't been in years.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.040 line:11 align:middle
So I can take the racing form
and 'The Blood-Horse', right?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.760 line:11 align:middle
Your dad doesn't want
me teaching you about horses.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.560 line:12 align:middle
So I should leave 'em?

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.680 line:11 align:middle
You should stuff 'em
under your shirt.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.440 line:12 align:middle
(Laughs) OK.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.640 line:11 align:middle
Cale, in that cabinet
above the sink...

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.320 line:12 align:middle
Yeah.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:38:30.000 line:12 align:middle
..is there a coffee can?

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.480 line:12 align:middle
Mm-hm.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.960 line:11 align:middle
Bring it to your dad, would ya?
Sure.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.600 line:12 align:middle
Goodnight.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.120 line:12 align:middle
Goodnight.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:51.680 line:11 align:middle
Pop wanted me to give this to you.
Thanks, hon.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.600 line:11 align:middle
I'm gonna eat my dessert in the barn.
Alright.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.280 line:12 align:middle
(Sighs)

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.200 line:11 align:middle
BEN: What the hell is this?
POP: Coffee can.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.480 line:11 align:middle
You expect me to use it?
It's the only flavour I got.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.920 line:11 align:middle
You're unbelievable.
There's almost $20,000 there.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.520 line:11 align:middle
You watched me
sell this farm off bit by bit

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.400 line:12 align:middle
till there was nothing left.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:39:30.280 line:11 align:middle
Why are you doing this?
Damned if I know.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.600 line:12 align:middle
Breed the horse, Ben.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.560 line:12 align:middle
Picking up that filly

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.560 line:11 align:middle
was the gutsiest thing
I've seen you do in years.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.040 line:12 align:middle
Don't talk to me about guts.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.280 line:11 align:middle
I took the biggest swing I could
and I struck out.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.160 line:11 align:middle
Then you gave up.
I broke, Pop!

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.200 line:12 align:middle
What do you expect me to do?

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.960 line:12 align:middle
I expect you to take the money,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.800 line:11 align:middle
trust your instincts,
and breed the horse.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.320 line:12 align:middle
You told me to put her down.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.080 line:11 align:middle
But you didn't, did you?
'Cause you're a horseman.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.640 line:12 align:middle
Oh, don't blow smoke...

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.360 line:11 align:middle
Are you gonna spend your life
shovelling horse squat for sheiks

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:00.440 line:11 align:middle
or are you gonna
get back in the game?

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.920 line:11 align:middle
Don't think I don't know what's
going on here with you and Cale.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.120 line:12 align:middle
It's in her blood, Ben.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.960 line:12 align:middle
Cale's a beautiful kid.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.640 line:12 align:middle
And I don't want this life for her,

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.400 line:11 align:middle
so stop filling her head
with horse stories.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.960 line:11 align:middle
Horse stories are all I got.
Good, then keep 'em to yourself.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.800 line:11 align:middle
I'll pay you back
when the foal sells.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.960 line:12 align:middle
(Slams door)

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.760 line:12 align:middle
Any chance you'll keep the foal?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.560 line:12 align:middle
Race him or her?

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.520 line:12 align:middle
No, we're gonna sell the foal.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.000 line:12 align:middle
But we'll still have Sonador.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.760 line:12 align:middle
Sonador?

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.200 line:12 align:middle
Yeah, that's her full name - Sonador.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.200 line:12 align:middle
Sonador.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.080 line:12 align:middle
It's Spanish.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.480 line:12 align:middle
Spanish for 'dreamer'.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:40:01.720 line:12 align:middle
Goodnight, Dreamer.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.840 line:11 align:middle
OK, I got it.
I'm going to Pop's.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.160 line:11 align:middle
Lil, how many days did they give you
down at the diner?

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.720 line:12 align:middle
I got Monday, Wednesday and Friday

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.080 line:12 align:middle
but I could take more.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.560 line:11 align:middle
Palmer called around -
pretty much shut me out everywhere.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.280 line:12 align:middle
I can't find any work.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:41:32.640 line:12 align:middle
I'm gonna have to take down the sign.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.120 line:12 align:middle
The real estate sign?

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.000 line:12 align:middle
It's all been sold.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.800 line:11 align:middle
Only land we got left to sell
we're sitting on.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.040 line:11 align:middle
Here's the first letter
of foreclosure.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.880 line:11 align:middle
Morning.
DOC FLEMING: Hello, Cale.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.480 line:11 align:middle
BALON: Hey, Doc.
Balon. Manny.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.960 line:11 align:middle
Sonya's gonna make us some money,
huh?

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.000 line:11 align:middle
This horse,
she gonna make a special baby, huh?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.400 line:11 align:middle
Is Ben around?
Yeah, right here.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:00.720 line:11 align:middle
Alright, I just got off the phone
with Bill.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.320 line:11 align:middle
We're back on.
BALON: Oh, yes!

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.880 line:12 align:middle
Gonna breed her to Grand Slam.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.600 line:11 align:middle
Ben, I've completed my tests
and I've got some bad news for you.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.520 line:12 align:middle
What?

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.320 line:12 align:middle
She's infertile.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.800 line:12 align:middle
She's not gonna have a baby now?

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.040 line:11 align:middle
No, honey,
she's never gonna have babies.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.720 line:12 align:middle
I'm sorry, guys.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.920 line:12 align:middle
(Quietly) Sorry, Sonya.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.720 line:12 align:middle
It's OK.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.440 line:12 align:middle
It's almost dawn.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:01.920 line:12 align:middle
You've been up all night.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.880 line:11 align:middle
What was I thinking, Lil,
trying to breed that horse?

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.240 line:12 align:middle
Cale loves that horse.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.760 line:11 align:middle
That's good 'cause that little filly
just ruined us.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.480 line:11 align:middle
That little filly is the best thing
that's ever happened around here.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.280 line:12 align:middle
Oh, come on, Lil.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.200 line:11 align:middle
Since she's been in that barn,
we have a family

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.600 line:12 align:middle
for the first time in years.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.640 line:11 align:middle
Look, I'll work seven days a week
at the diner

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.840 line:11 align:middle
if it means you'll spend time
with your daughter.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:43:31.800 line:11 align:middle
Can't you see
how much she wants to be with you?

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.720 line:11 align:middle
And I know
that your dad disappointed you

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.960 line:11 align:middle
but that does not mean
that you have to disappoint her.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.760 line:11 align:middle
This has nothing
to do with my father.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.280 line:11 align:middle
It has everything
to do with your father.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.880 line:12 align:middle
You're wrong!

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.120 line:11 align:middle
Truth is, if Cale
hadn't have been with me that night,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.800 line:11 align:middle
I'd have left that horse
on the track

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.920 line:11 align:middle
or let them put the horse down.
Then I'd still have my job.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.240 line:12 align:middle
Cale, I...

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.880 line:12 align:middle
Cale.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.480 line:12 align:middle

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.400 line:12 align:middle
Come on, Cale.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.440 line:12 align:middle
Honey, can I come in?

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.240 line:11 align:middle
Come on.
Let's just give her some time.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.000 line:12 align:middle
Cale? Come on, honey, open the door.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.000 line:12 align:middle

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.880 line:11 align:middle
She'll come downstairs
when she's ready.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.920 line:12 align:middle
We're gonna run away.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.560 line:12 align:middle
(Sniffs) We're gonna run far away.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.040 line:12 align:middle
There you go.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.560 line:12 align:middle
Just gonna go for a little walk.

for a minute, boss?

Right. How's Sonya?

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.200 line:11 align:middle
She was running back and forth
along the fence and, ah...

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.280 line:11 align:middle
..we were following her
in the truck...

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.240 line:11 align:middle
Balon, did she break down?
How bad is she?

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.400 line:11 align:middle
Well, in the truck
it said that she's about,

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.200 line:12 align:middle

00:46:29.360 --> 00:47:31.000 line:12 align:middle
Are you saying she should race?

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.160 line:12 align:middle
You can load her up, John.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.560 line:11 align:middle
Mariah's Storm broke her leg
the same way as Sonya.

She sure was.

show it to you, Ben.

Oh, yeah, that leg's good.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.080 line:11 align:middle
Yep. 'Bye.
Goodbye.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.320 line:12 align:middle
Well, she's not favouring that leg.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.560 line:12 align:middle
How's she look?

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.600 line:12 align:middle
She looks big.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.360 line:11 align:middle
Big as in strong?
No, big as in fat.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.480 line:12 align:middle
That's mean.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.360 line:12 align:middle
That's mean. You shouldn't say that.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:48:02.200 line:11 align:middle
Well, she's been eating
too many popsicles.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.160 line:12 align:middle

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.680 line:11 align:middle

What do you think?

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.280 line:12 align:middle
Well, in five weeks,

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.360 line:11 align:middle
the best she's done
is three furlongs in 37 seconds.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.480 line:12 align:middle
Not fast enough to win much, is it?

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.720 line:12 align:middle
Maybe a cheap claimer

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.640 line:12 align:middle
or Bluegrass Downs.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.720 line:12 align:middle
She was a Graded Stakes horse.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.920 line:12 align:middle
Now she's a claimer.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.240 line:11 align:middle
Might be a good idea
to run her in one.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.640 line:12 align:middle
See if she perks up in a real race.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.560 line:12 align:middle
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.960 line:11 align:middle
You don't think
anybody would claim her, do you?

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.400 line:11 align:middle
Would you buy a horse
that broke its leg?

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.760 line:12 align:middle
Well, she might win.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:50:30.160 line:12 align:middle
Could be easy money.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.720 line:11 align:middle

Getting away to a beautiful start.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.320 line:11 align:middle

Come on, Sonador.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.680 line:11 align:middle
Come on.
Can you see her?

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.600 line:11 align:middle

Sonador.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.560 line:12 align:middle

Third.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.720 line:11 align:middle

but it's the beginning.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.960 line:11 align:middle

I think she would've won, sir.

Whoo! (Laughs)

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.200 line:11 align:middle
It's third place.
So, what does she get?

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.880 line:12 align:middle
$1,100.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:51:01.120 line:11 align:middle
Sonador. Ben Crane?
Yeah.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.000 line:11 align:middle
Claim.
What?! You gotta be kidding me.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.520 line:11 align:middle
Claim?
Wait a second. Hang on a minute.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.160 line:12 align:middle
You said she wouldn't get claimed.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.840 line:12 align:middle
Cale, listen to me.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.120 line:11 align:middle
What was the tag?
How much did you get for her?

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.920 line:12 align:middle
$15,000.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.960 line:12 align:middle
You just sold Sonador.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.800 line:12 align:middle
I don't believe this.

Out of a hundred horses that
could have been claimed tonight,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.560 line:12 align:middle
you know how many got claimed?

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.080 line:12 align:middle
Two.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.200 line:11 align:middle
Do you understand
that you've got to claim the horse

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.840 line:12 align:middle
before the race is even run?

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.480 line:11 align:middle
I just figured there's no way anybody
would take a chance on a filly

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.120 line:12 align:middle
that had already broken her leg.

She's gone.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.960 line:12 align:middle
She was a good horse, Cale.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.560 line:12 align:middle
I'm gonna miss her too.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.560 line:11 align:middle
Please don't treat me
like a little kid.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.000 line:11 align:middle
You should try to get
some of your money back.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.160 line:12 align:middle
I get it. It's business.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.120 line:12 align:middle

to sell Sonya, OK?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.400 line:12 align:middle
You lied to me.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.600 line:11 align:middle
You said I'd always have Sonador.
You stood right there and said it.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.360 line:12 align:middle
You raced her and she got claimed.

Now, Cale,
I put 51% of Sonador in your name.

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.880 line:11 align:middle
So from here on out,
you make all the decisions.

00:59:59.920 --> 00:59:02.120 line:11 align:middle
Don't worry -
I got you in there at 39%.

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.200 line:11 align:middle
Balon, you and Manny
can split the other 10%, huh?

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.760 line:12 align:middle
What are you saying, Ben?

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.000 line:11 align:middle
I'm saying as soon as
she signs this paper,

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:13.680 line:11 align:middle
the new owner of Sonador
is Cale Crane.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.920 line:11 align:middle
Welcome to the race business.
Congratulations.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.560 line:12 align:middle

Do you want me to warm her up?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.560 line:11 align:middle
And then push her
for three furlongs? Or maybe four?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.560 line:11 align:middle
You just want us
to blow her out today, right?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.560 line:11 align:middle
Then we could start
to build her up, huh?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600 line:12 align:middle
Um...

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.600 line:12 align:middle

you let me know, huh?

She won over $200,000
in Graded company.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.040 line:12 align:middle
Oh, yeah. I know.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.520 line:11 align:middle
Qualifies her for
a lot of Stakes races.

all of Sonador's possible races.

I'm sure 29 October is the same day

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.640 line:11 align:middle
as the running of the
Breeders' Cup Championship, isn't it?

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.480 line:12 align:middle
Biggest day in racing.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.360 line:11 align:middle
Yeah. The Breeders' Cup is, what,
eight races, worth $14 million?

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.680 line:11 align:middle

in any race

as the Breeders' Cup.

You're right.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:03:33.720 line:11 align:middle
We shouldn't run in any race
the same day as Breeders' Cup.

I wanna run in the Classic."

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.160 line:11 align:middle
It doesn't work that way.
It'd be nice if it did.

the selection process is?

Uh...14 horses. First seven
or greatest Stakes wins, points.

Last seven are...
No. No. I don't, really.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.840 line:11 align:middle
The last seven are based on
overall performance during the year.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.200 line:11 align:middle
But they do have the ability
to make a judgment call.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.160 line:12 align:middle
I might take a shot.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.520 line:11 align:middle

but why not Sonador?

the last seven horses were chosen?

has come to rescue me?

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.720 line:11 align:middle
We'll see you tomorrow.
PAT: See you later.

Is Cale with Pop?

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.720 line:11 align:middle
Yeah. They're going over
race strategies.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.520 line:12 align:middle
Oh, she didn't get in?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.040 line:12 align:middle
Selection's in the morning.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.160 line:11 align:middle
How did Cale do
in front of the committee?

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.800 line:12 align:middle
The truth? It was rough.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.960 line:12 align:middle
She got kicked around pretty good.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.440 line:12 align:middle
Why are you smiling?

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.360 line:12 align:middle
Because she kicked right back.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.360 line:12 align:middle
Yeah, she reminds me of somebody.

You were right, Lil.

It was great just letting her try.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.520 line:12 align:middle
So you're saying that I'm smart?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.200 line:11 align:middle
I'm saying you're smart
and beautiful.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:09:31.840 line:11 align:middle
You think she has
a chance of getting in.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.320 line:12 align:middle
There's a chance.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.480 line:12 align:middle
And the entry fees are $120,000, OK?

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.320 line:12 align:middle

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.560 line:12 align:middle
Time for bed, honey.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.680 line:11 align:middle
That works a little better
than a bucket, now, doesn't it?

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.800 line:12 align:middle
(Chuckles) Yes.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.360 line:11 align:middle
So how much are you gonna bet on
Sonador winning the Classic?

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.240 line:12 align:middle
Don't you think she can win?

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.520 line:11 align:middle
Well...
You've gotta think she can win.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.440 line:11 align:middle
What's the harm
in thinking she can win?

01:09:29.520 --> 01:10:31.640 line:12 align:middle
Say "I think she can win".

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.120 line:12 align:middle
I think she can win.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.600 line:12 align:middle
Good.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.640 line:12 align:middle

..how much it's worth to you...

..to have this broken filly
finish 14th in a field of 14.

passing a horse
with each and every stride

01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:00.560 line:12 align:middle
as they come to the top.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.600 line:11 align:middle
Now Sonador
now looking for the victor.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:12.600 line:11 align:middle

Take it. Go.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.320 line:11 align:middle

the danger to the favourite,

RACE CALLER: Sonador!

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.280 line:12 align:middle
Whoo!

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.880 line:12 align:middle
Oh, man, I had a dream.

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.280 line:11 align:middle
It was a dream I didn't
know the end of until today!

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.880 line:12 align:middle
Whoo!

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.400 line:12 align:middle

That's $20,000. I'm back.

CALE: You are a great champion.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.880 line:12 align:middle
When you ran, the ground shook,

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.280 line:11 align:middle
the sky opened
and mere mortals parted,

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.760 line:12 align:middle
parted the way to victory,

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.080 line:11 align:middle
where you'll meet me
in the winner's circle,

01:34:28.120 --> 01:35:31.840 line:11 align:middle
where I'll put
a blanket of flowers on your back.

# With a memory

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.600 line:1 align:middle
# Love came and whispered a story

01:35:59.640 --> 01:35:03.680 line:1 align:middle
# That awakened a dream

# And a beautiful king

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.560 line:1 align:middle
# He left the comfort of his throne

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.680 line:1 align:middle

# Open the sky up

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.080 line:1 align:middle
# Start a fire

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:50.760 line:1 align:middle
# I believe even
if it's just a dream

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:01.840 line:1 align:middle
# They woke me up this morning

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.880 line:1 align:middle
# And I ran to see

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.560 line:1 align:middle
# The king in the winner's circle

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.400 line:1 align:middle
# On the horse he won for me

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.240 line:1 align:middle
# Hey, yeah... #
