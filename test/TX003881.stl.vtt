00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.000 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Pop, who was Dreamcatcher?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%

Downtown Swing.

Did you ever ride him again?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.760 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Yeah. In his second race
I was flying into that first turn.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.840 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Then I looked under my arm
to see if I was clear on the rail.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.120 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

there was a horse swerving into me.

I fell to the ground

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.200 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
and I got run over by three horses.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Broke both shoulders,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.360 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.400 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

on a very fast horse.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.560 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
I look to my left foot, it slips out
of the iron and I begin to fall.

I wake up.

..it's just me and the horse,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.600 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
alone on the track, free,

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.680 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.680 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
200 acres.
One of the nicest in Versailles.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.960 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
<c.black>............</c>See all that over there?
Yeah.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.920 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, that was ours.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.040 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Pop's owned
some really nice race mares.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.640 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Big, beautiful female horses.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.240 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Wave Land, Blue Jezebel
and Miss Muffet.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.000 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
That's right.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.920 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Pop said he built those stalls
and filled them with horses.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.360 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Yeah, he made a good living
selling yearlings.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.040 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
But you wanted to keep yearlings
and race them, right?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.560 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, it got kinda hard.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.000 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
We had some horses born on this farm

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.920 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
go on to win big races
for somebody else.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.960 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
So you got Pop
to keep some of the yearlings

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
so you could train 'em, race 'em?

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.760 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
You don't just keep 'em, Cale.
They're not free.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.280 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I'm gonna brush down Sonya.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.240 line:83% align:left position:30% size:50%
Cale Crane?

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yes, ma'am.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.560 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Are you working on
your creative writing assignment?

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yes, ma'am.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.280 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
What's your story about?

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's about a king

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
in his castle.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And a magic horse.

( GENTLE MUSIC )

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.040 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
'Bye!

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.000 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
She can stand on it.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.400 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Not for long...
but she can stand on it.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.200 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
I'll run a couple more tests
in the morning, Ben,

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.600 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
but I don't see any reason
she can't breed - she looks good.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.280 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
You helped her, Cale.
She's gonna have a baby! Yeah!

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.880 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I'll see you Friday.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.920 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, I'm gonna call in a favour.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.320 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
(Whispers) Go, Cale.

Gonna go see an old friend.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.280 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
About a stud for Sonya?

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.320 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Yeah, about a stud.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.200 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
You wanna come?

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.600 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Yeah, I'll come.

Did you see him?

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.360 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
It's Fusaichi.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Did you learn all that from Pop too?

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
He's a beautiful horse.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.600 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Hey, Bill, it's good to see you.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.120 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Good to see you.

<c.black>..................</c>Hi.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.320 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
Nice to meet you, Cale.
<c.black>..............</c>Nice to meet you too.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.240 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
So, Ben, you call me two months ago

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.560 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
telling me you've got this race mare
needs to be covered,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.640 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
you need a favour,
then I don't hear from you.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.880 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, it's been a pretty long road
with that filly, Bill,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.560 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
but she's ready to go now.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.160 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
So, are you still gonna be able
to help me out here?

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.840 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Right over here.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.000 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.640 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
are you ready
for the world's greatest stud?

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.320 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Come on, Todd, bring him on out.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
That's not...

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.240 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
What is that?
<c.black>..........</c>This here's Thunderpants.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.040 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Honey,
Thunderpants is a teaser pony.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.000 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
He's gonna help Sonya get ready
to go into the breeding shed

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.600 line:83% align:left position:16% size:64%
with the stallion.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.280 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Thank you, Bill.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.440 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Hey, Cale,

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.600 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%

I picked for ya?

( HORSE WHINNIES )

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.400 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Cale, meet Grand Slam.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Grand Slam?

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.160 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Unbelievable.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.920 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
So...what do you think?

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.760 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
(Exhales)

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.880 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, I think it's Grand Slam.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.640 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
(Chuckles)

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.400 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Everyone at Ashford
has a lot of respect for your family.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.960 line:83% align:left position:16% size:64%
I explained your situation

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.200 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
and they want to do you
the favour of a lifetime.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.800 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I just...I don't know what to say.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.760 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Say you'll have your filly here
first week in May.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.240 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
You got it.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.920 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
That week's the only shot you get.
<c.black>.................................</c>OK.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.400 line:83% align:left position:16% size:64%
He's booked till next year.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.040 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
And you've gotta send me half of
the £15,000 by the end of the week.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.080 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
That's, ah...£15,000. Ah...

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.600 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Well, Grand Slam's normal stud fees
are £200,000.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.480 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
We're waiving that completely.
<c.black>................</c>Yeah, I know, but...

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.840 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
The £15,000 doesn't even cover
our costs and insurance.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.680 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
No, Bill, it's an amazing offer.
I just didn't, you know, I-I...

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.800 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
I'm wondering, though,
if maybe I couldn't, you know,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.160 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
give you a share in the foal
to cover all the expenses,

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.560 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
whatever they are.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.320 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
We...we just don't do that.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.960 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Not in a case like this.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.120 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Are you saying
you want to call it off?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.880 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
No, it's...

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.000 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Bill, I don't have the money.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.800 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
I'm sorry, Ben.
I didn't fully know your situation.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.280 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
That's OK, Bill. Listen,
I really appreciate you trying.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.200 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I'm gonna call, alright? Thanks.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Let's go, honey.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.680 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
POP: I've never seen
Grand Slam up close.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.680 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
CALE: He's got muscles everywhere.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.240 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
What did he say?

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.280 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
He's a horse.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.160 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I know. What did he say?

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.080 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
"I am a great champion."

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.680 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
"When I ran, the ground shook,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.400 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
"the sky opened
and mere mortals parted..."

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.280 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
"..the way to victory.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.080 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
"And I met my owner
in the winner's circle."

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.320 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
"Where he put a blanket of flowers
on my back."

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.160 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
(Laughs) You remembered that.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.800 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Sport of kings, you know that?

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.280 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
They call horseracing
the sport of kings.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.600 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
So when are you going to take me
to the races?

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.080 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
I don't go anymore.
Haven't been in years.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.040 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
So I can take the racing form
and 'The Blood-Horse', right?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.760 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Your dad doesn't want
me teaching you about horses.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
So I should leave 'em?

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.680 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
You should stuff 'em
under your shirt.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.440 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
(Laughs) OK.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.640 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Cale, in that cabinet
above the sink...

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.320 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Yeah.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.000 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
..is there a coffee can?

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Mm-hm.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.960 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
<c.black>.....</c>Bring it to your dad, would ya?
Sure.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Goodnight.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.120 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Goodnight.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.680 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
<c.black>..</c>Pop wanted me to give this to you.
Thanks, hon.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.600 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
I'm gonna eat my dessert in the barn.
<c.black>.....</c>Alright.

You're unbelievable.
There's almost £20,000 there.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.520 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
You watched me
sell this farm off bit by bit

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.400 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
till there was nothing left.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.280 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

Damned if I know.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.600 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Breed the horse, Ben.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Picking up that filly

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.560 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
was the gutsiest thing
I've seen you do in years.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.040 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Don't talk to me about guts.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.280 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
I took the biggest swing I could
and I struck out.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.160 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
Then you gave up.
<c.black>......................</c>I broke, Pop!

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.200 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
What do you expect me to do?

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.960 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
I expect you to take the money,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.800 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
trust your instincts,
and breed the horse.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.320 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
You told me to put her down.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.080 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
But you didn't, did you?
'Cause you're a horseman.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.640 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Oh, don't blow smoke...

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.360 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Are you gonna spend your life
shovelling horse squat for sheiks

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.440 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
or are you gonna
get back in the game?

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.920 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Don't think I don't know what's
going on here with you and Cale.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.120 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
It's in her blood, Ben.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.960 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Cale's a beautiful kid.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.640 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
And I don't want this life for her,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.400 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
so stop filling her head
with horse stories.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.960 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
Horse stories are all I got.
<c.black>...</c>Good, then keep 'em to yourself.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.800 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
I'll pay you back
when the foal sells.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.760 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Any chance you'll keep the foal?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.560 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Race him or her?

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
No, we're gonna sell the foal.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.000 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
But we'll still have Sonador.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.760 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Sonador?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.200 line:83% align:left position:16% size:64%
Yeah, that's her full name - Sonador.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.200 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Sonador.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.080 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
It's Spanish.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.480 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Spanish for 'dreamer'.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.720 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Goodnight, Dreamer.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.840 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

Lil, how many days did they give you
down at the diner?

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.720 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I got Monday, Wednesday and Friday

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.080 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
but I could take more.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.560 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Palmer called around -
pretty much shut me out everywhere.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.280 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
I can't find any work.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.640 line:83% align:left position:16% size:64%
I'm gonna have to take down the sign.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.120 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
The real estate sign?

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.000 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
It's all been sold.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.800 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

and I've got some bad news for you.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
What?

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.320 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
She's infertile.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.800 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
She's not gonna have a baby now?

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.040 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
No, honey,
she's never gonna have babies.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
I'm sorry, guys.

trying to breed that horse?

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.240 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Cale loves that horse.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.760 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
That's good 'cause that little filly
just ruined us.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.480 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
That little filly is the best thing
that's ever happened around here.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.280 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Oh, come on, Lil.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.200 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

we have a family

at the diner

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.840 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
if it means you'll spend time
with your daughter.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.800 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Can't you see
how much she wants to be with you?

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.720 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
And I know
that your dad disappointed you

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.960 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
but that does not mean
that you have to disappoint her.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.760 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
This has nothing
to do with my father.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.280 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
It has everything
to do with your father.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.880 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
You're wrong!

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.120 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Truth is, if Cale
hadn't have been with me that night,

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.800 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
I'd have left that horse
on the track

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.920 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
or let them put the horse down.
Then I'd still have my job.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.240 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Mariah's Storm broke her leg
the same way as Sonya.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.440 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Same fracture, same location.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.920 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Who's Mariah's Storm?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.040 line:77% align:left position:24% size:56%
She was a great racehorse.
<c.black>...................</c>She sure was.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Made a big comeback too.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.560 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Came back and beat Serena's Song
in the Graded Stakes.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.120 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
When I saw Sonya's X-rays,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.120 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
I thought I ought to
show it to you, Ben.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.200 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
That bone is healed.
<c.black>.........</c>Oh, yeah, that leg's good.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.920 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
But getting her back into
racing shape, that's up to you.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.560 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Good luck.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.240 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Thanks a lot, Doc.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.080 line:77% align:left position:50% size:30%
<c.black>.........</c>Yep. 'Bye.
Goodbye.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.320 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, she's not favouring that leg.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
How's she look?

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.600 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
She looks big.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.360 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
Big as in strong?
<c.black>.................</c>No, big as in fat.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.480 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
That's mean.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.360 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
That's mean. You shouldn't say that.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.200 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, she's been eating
too many popsicles.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.160 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
(Laughs) What?

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.680 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
'What?' You didn't know
I knew about that, did you?

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.240 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
(Chuckles)

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.960 line:77% align:left position:46% size:34%
37:02.
<c.black>......</c>37:02.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
36.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.840 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
What do you think?

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.280 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Well, in five weeks,

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.360 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
the best she's done
is three furlongs in 37 seconds.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.480 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Not fast enough to win much, is it?

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.720 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Maybe a cheap claimer

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.640 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
or Bluegrass Downs.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.720 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
She was a Graded Stakes horse.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.920 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Now she's a claimer.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.240 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Might be a good idea
to run her in one.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.640 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
See if she perks up in a real race.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.960 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
You don't think
anybody would claim her, do you?

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.400 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Would you buy a horse
that broke its leg?

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.760 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Well, she might win.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.160 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Could be easy money.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
RACE CALLER: And away they go.
Getting away to a beautiful start.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And Super 35
from the extreme outside.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Coming from behind into the race,
Sonador.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.080 line:77% align:left position:28% size:52%
Little lady looks pretty good.
<c.black>........</c>Yeah.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.040 line:77% align:left position:36% size:44%
Come on, Sonya.
<c.black>.........</c>Come on, Sonador.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.680 line:77% align:left position:26% size:54%
<c.black>................</c>Come on.
Can you see her?

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And fourth into the straight,
Sonador.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And Sonador's on the far outside.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Then we have, back in fifth,
All for Nothing...

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.040 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Come on, baby.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.760 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Come on, Mike, change her lead now.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
..coming around the far turn...

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.360 line:77% align:left position:34% size:46%
<c.black>..............</c>Come on!
Come on, girl!

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
..comes Obvious Favorite,
Storm Boy's running in third...

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.160 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Come on, Sonya.
Only three furlongs to go now.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(Screams)

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Major Easy and Obvious Favorite
are nose-to-nose...

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.760 line:77% align:left position:48% size:32%
Show her the stick.
Get her out of there.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
..in between horses...

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(Horse whinnies)

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.960 line:77% align:left position:34% size:46%
<c.black>....</c>(Squeals)
Third!

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.320 line:77% align:left position:30% size:50%
Third.
<c.black>......</c>Third.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.720 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
01:13 - a little slow,
but it's the beginning.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.960 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
If Mike wouldn't have been boxed in,
I think she would've won, sir.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Whoo! (Laughs)

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.200 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
It's third place.
So, what does she get?

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
£1,100.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.120 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
Sonador. Ben Crane?
<c.black>...................</c>Yeah.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.000 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
Claim.
<c.black>....</c>What?! You gotta be kidding me.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.520 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
<c.black>.............</c>Claim?
Wait a second. Hang on a minute.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.160 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
You said she wouldn't get claimed.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.840 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Cale, listen to me.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.120 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
What was the tag?
How much did you get for her?

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.920 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
£15,000.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.960 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
You just sold Sonador.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.800 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
I don't believe this.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.920 line:83% align:left position:28% size:52%
Cale...

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.440 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
..I wasn't trying to sell Sonya.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.080 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Out of a hundred horses that
could have been claimed tonight,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.560 line:83% align:left position:16% size:64%
you know how many got claimed?

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.080 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Two.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.200 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Do you understand
that you've got to claim the horse

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.840 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
before the race is even run?

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.480 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
I just figured there's no way anybody
would take a chance on a filly

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.120 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
that had already broken her leg.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.520 line:83% align:left position:62% size:18%
(Sighs)

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.560 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I guess there was some chance.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.080 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
She's gone.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.960 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
She was a good horse, Cale.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.560 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
I'm gonna miss her too.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.560 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Please don't treat me
like a little kid.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.000 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
You should try to get
some of your money back.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.160 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
I get it. It's business.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.120 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
That's right. It is.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.840 line:83% align:left position:64% size:16%
(Sighs)

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.880 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
But I wasn't trying
to sell Sonya, OK?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.400 line:83% align:left position:54% size:26%
You lied to me.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.600 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
You said I'd always have Sonador.
You stood right there and said it.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You raced her and she got claimed.

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.360 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, welcome to the world
of horseracing, Cale,

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.600 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
where everything doesn't end up
the way you want it to.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She wasn't for sale!

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.640 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Every racehorse everywhere
in the world right now is for sale.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.120 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Get that.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.480 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
She wasn't just some racehorse.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.000 line:83% align:left position:24% size:56%
She was our horse.

I told Pat that I was gonna
work the dinner shift tonight.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.880 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
Remember?

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.120 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
You said you could go to
Cale's school for parents night.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.640 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%
8:00. I'll be there.
<c.black>............................</c>Mm-hmm.

overall performance during the year.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.520 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
It's a long shot
but why not Sonador?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.520 line:83% align:left position:18% size:62%
Why not us?

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.280 line:77% align:left position:18% size:62%

the last seven horses were chosen?

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.560 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
No, I didn't. Why would I?
I've never been there.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.040 line:83% align:right size:80% position:90%
But if Sonya does get in,

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.680 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
I can tell you there's gonna be
huge fees for a race like that, so...

I do.

this isn't gonna happen, that's all.

So what?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.960 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
Just let it take her
as far as it can.

is the son of Stormcat -

the best sire in the world.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.440 line:77% align:left position:30% size:50%

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.520 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Well, Miss, your horse Sonador
has 20 points.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.440 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
And that puts her at 16th
on the list.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.080 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%
Although I see that last year,
she had 42 points.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Yes, sir.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.080 line:77% align:left position:16% size:64%
She'd have that many points
this year except she was injured.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.560 line:83% align:left position:52% size:28%
She was injured?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.920 line:77% align:right size:80% position:90%

says she's sound?

parted the way to victory,

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
where you'll meet me
in the winner's circle,

where I'll put
a blanket of flowers on your back.
