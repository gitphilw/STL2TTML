<c.cyan>Kids talk turned to...</c>
<c.cyan>soon to be killers.</c>

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She knew something was going</c>
<c.yellow>to happen.</c>

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Marlene Olive wanted</c>
<c.cyan>her mother killed.</c>

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She walked around at</c>
<c.yellow>school like a zombie.</c>

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She was constantly</c>
<c.green>fighting with the mother.</c>

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>It was an extremely</c>
<c.yellow>bloody crime scene.</c>

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Brian Salter and Jeffrey</c>
<c.cyan>Dillingham, before that night,</c>

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>were good kids.</c>

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She promised a million dollars each.</c>

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Some children, they're</c>
<c.green>just going to turn out bad.</c>

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Women have manipulated boys and men</c>
<c.yellow>to do the dirty work for them.</c>

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.760 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Some kids are born
with a silver spoon.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.360 line:70% align:middle position:50% size:80%
For others, it's more of a knife.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Like Kristi Koslow.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.400 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Kristi was a bit</c>
<c.cyan>of a troubled child.</c>

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She was born on</c>
<c.cyan>Valentine's Day, 1975</c>

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and she was adopted by Jack Koslow</c>
<c.cyan>and his first wife, Paula.</c>

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Later, when she was 6 years old,</c>

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.160 line:20% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>the parents separated and Kristi</c>
<c.cyan>went to live with her mother</c>

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.680 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>although both parents</c>
<c.cyan>lived in the same town.</c>

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The first hint
of trouble comes

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
when her father gets
remarried to Caren Koslow.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jack and Caren Koslow were part of</c>

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>the social scene in Fort Worth.</c>

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He was a banker.</c>

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.160 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Caren Koslow was from a</c>
<c.yellow>fairly prominent family.</c>

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>I believe they had a lot of</c>
<c.yellow>oil and ranching type interests.</c>

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.880 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>They lived in a very</c>
<c.yellow>nice neighbourhood</c>

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>in Fort Worth known as River Crest.</c>

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But this paradise has
its share of problems.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Over the next few years,
Kristi finds herself

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
in the middle of arguments between
her divorced mother and father

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and as she becomes more and
more aware of their tensions

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
over child support,
she too becomes increasingly angry

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
towards her father, resentful of
his comfortable, affluent lifestyle

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
where she is only a visitor.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Kristi Koslow's childhood</c>
<c.green>was a difficult childhood.</c>

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Although she grew up in</c>
<c.green>advantaged circumstances,</c>

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.400 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>she developed behavioural problems</c>
<c.green>as she was growing up.</c>

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She reportedly did not get along</c>
<c.cyan>with her father all that well.</c>

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>I think part of</c>
<c.cyan>the issue was the divorce</c>

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>between her mother and her dad.</c>

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>When Kristi was younger,</c>

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>she didn't like being disciplined</c>
<c.yellow>or told what to do.</c>

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She thought she should be able</c>
<c.yellow>to do what she wanted to</c>

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and she didn't get along</c>
<c.yellow>well with Caren Koslow</c>

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>according to what</c>
<c.yellow>Jack Koslow told us.</c>

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She went through a</c>
<c.green>succession of private schools.</c>

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She had a contentious relationship</c>
<c.green>with her new stepmother</c>

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>and she and her adopted</c>
<c.green>father, Jack Koslow,</c>

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>were not always on the</c>
<c.green>best terms, as I recall.</c>

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>There were reports that that</c>
<c.cyan>they were seeing a counsellor</c>

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>to try to work things out.</c>

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>They just did not get along.</c>

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She didn't want to go to school.</c>

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She didn't want to work.</c>

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He was having real problems with</c>
<c.yellow>the lifestyle that she had taken on</c>

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and the people that she was</c>
<c.yellow>hanging out and running with.</c>

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Kristi was very envious</c>

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>of her father's and</c>
<c.cyan>stepmother's lifestyle.</c>

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Kristi and her mum lived</c>
<c.cyan>of lesser means</c>

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>than her dad and her stepmum.</c>

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jack and Caren lived</c>
<c.cyan>a very affluent,</c>

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>very comfortable lifestyle.</c>
<c.cyan>Kristi did not.</c>

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>So, she was jealous.</c>

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In fact, Kristi Ann
Koslow has a good life,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
money, popularity, a stable home.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But she also has a temper.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She expects things to go her way.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And though she has no criminal
record, on more than one occasion,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
she will run away from home.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Beneath the surface,
an adolescent anger is boiling

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
but no-one realized just how
deeply Kristi's secret rage ran.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>There were a lot of people who</c>
<c.cyan>didn't know a lot about this girl</c>

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>until that night,</c>
<c.cyan>and then after that night</c>

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>everyone wanted to know</c>
<c.cyan>who Kristi Koslow was.</c>

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.800 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Events that occurred</c>
<c.green>in the Koslow house</c>

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.080 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>on the night of March 12th</c>
<c.green>must have been very horrendous</c>

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>because the crime scene</c>
<c.green>that was left behind was gruesome.</c>

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Early on the night</c>
<c.yellow>of March 12th, 1992,</c>

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Jack and Caren Koslow had</c>
<c.yellow>returned home from dinner.</c>

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Sometime around 10 o'clock or</c>
<c.yellow>so, he went to bed first,</c>

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.040 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>went to sleep.</c>

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>The night of the murder,</c>
<c.green>the two boys,</c>

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Brian Salter and Jeffrey Dillingham,</c>

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>my clients, gained</c>
<c.green>admittance to the home</c>

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>of Caren and Jack Koslow.</c>

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>They had been provided with</c>
<c.green>alarm code information and a map,</c>

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>a layout of the home.</c>

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>That night,</c>

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Kristi Koslow stayed</c>
<c.cyan>at her mother's house,</c>

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>which wasn't too far away</c>
<c.cyan>and just sat there and waited</c>

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>knowing that her</c>
<c.cyan>boyfriend and Jeffrey</c>

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>were breaking into</c>
<c.cyan>her father's home</c>

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>with the intentions of killing.</c>

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In the dark hours of the night,
they make their way inside

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and head upstairs.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>The next thing he</c>
<c.yellow>knew, he woke up,</c>

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>his wife was awake saying</c>
<c.yellow>"They're in the house".</c>

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He heard his burglar</c>
<c.yellow>alarm going off.</c>

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He looked over, there was a control</c>
<c.yellow>panel in the master bedroom.</c>

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He looked over at it</c>
<c.yellow>and saw that it was green</c>

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and it should've had a red light.</c>

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He jumped up ran to a</c>
<c.yellow>closet in the master bedroom</c>

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and tried to retrieve a gun.</c>

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>While he was doing that,</c>
<c.yellow>the bedroom door flew open</c>

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and the first of two suspects</c>
<c.yellow>entered into the bedroom.</c>

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They were attacked in their
bedroom in the early morning

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
by two individuals

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.040 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
who Jack did not recognize.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>They forced both he and Caren to</c>
<c.yellow>lie down at the foot of the bed.</c>

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Next thing he remembered</c>
<c.yellow>was somebody beating him.</c>

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The attack on Jack and Caren
Koslow was especially vicious.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jack Koslow</c>

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>fought violently,</c>
<c.cyan>struggled with them.</c>

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He was hit in the back of the head</c>

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>a number of times and he</c>
<c.yellow>also had his throat cut.</c>

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>They beat him severely,</c>

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>they beat her severely and wound up</c>
<c.green>killing her. Her wounds were fatal.</c>

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Jack was also beaten
and was stabbed in the neck.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>At some point,</c>

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>one of the young men,</c>
<c.cyan>who had a gun,</c>

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>accidentally fired that gun.</c>

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And when they did that, the shot</c>
<c.cyan>that rang out,</c>

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>the two young men</c>

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>felt that that shot</c>
<c.cyan>could alert neighbours</c>

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and the police would be</c>
<c.cyan>called, so they fled.</c>

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Because of the severe beating</c>
<c.green>and injuries inflicted on Mr. Koslow</c>

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>I suspect that they believed that</c>
<c.green>they'd probably killed him as well.</c>

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He woke up. His wife</c>
<c.yellow>was laying beside him.</c>

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He thought she might</c>
<c.yellow>be dead or dying.</c>

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He has no idea what period,</c>
<c.yellow>what the time frame was</c>

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>on that, but it did take</c>
<c.yellow>quite a bit of time.</c>

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He then tried to find the telephone</c>
<c.yellow>and operate the telephone</c>

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>there at the house to call 911</c>
<c.yellow>and was unable to do that.</c>

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Jack Koslow was able</c>
<c.yellow>to make his way out of the house</c>

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>to a neighbour's house</c>
<c.yellow>and called for help for him.</c>

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Investigators</c>
<c.cyan>thought that this was</c>

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>one of the most brutal</c>
<c.cyan>crimes they'd witnessed.</c>

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>It was an extremely</c>
<c.yellow>bloody crime scene.</c>

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>There was blood basically</c>
<c.yellow>splattered everywhere in the room.</c>

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But for all the blood, there's
little evidence, no clear motive.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And that will push the police to
investigate the victims themselves.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.280 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>An interesting part of this</c>
<c.cyan>crime is that for a number of weeks</c>

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.080 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>after the murder, the police</c>
<c.cyan>focused their investigation</c>

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.600 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>on Jack thinking that</c>
<c.cyan>he had been his wife's killer.</c>

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.080 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The elements of the crime scene</c>
<c.cyan>indicated at first glance</c>

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>that Jack Koslow would be</c>
<c.cyan>a person of interest,</c>

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.720 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>because Caren Koslow was brutalized</c>

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.400 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>while Mr. Koslow</c>
<c.cyan>obviously survived.</c>

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.560 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
You begin looking

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.480 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
at the people closest to the victim
and work your way out from there.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.280 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And very often, we find in
criminal investigations that

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the people closest to the victim
are the perpetrators of the crime.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.720 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And the police

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.600 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
began with that theory in mind
and for a period of time

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.960 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
did not advance beyond that theory.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.200 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Not only the police,</c>
<c.cyan>but the entire town</c>

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>who followed this case, felt</c>
<c.cyan>that Jack Koslow was the killer.</c>

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.920 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He was certainly a person of</c>
<c.yellow>interest and we would've been</c>

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.680 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>remiss to not look at him.</c>

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>I mean, anybody that's worked</c>
<c.yellow>murder investigations very much,</c>

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.600 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>especially one where you have</c>
<c.yellow>a male and a female victim</c>

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.720 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and the male survives</c>
<c.yellow>and the female doesn't</c>

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.120 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and there's a gap in time.</c>

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.600 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>I mean, there were a lot of things</c>
<c.yellow>that were certainly suspicious</c>

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.120 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>about Jack Koslow's initial story.</c>

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
A lot of the evidence does
indeed seem to point to Jack.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The autopsy report suggests
that Caren Koslow

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.400 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
may have died before midnight.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But Jack didn't come out for help
until four hours later.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jack was very open with the police.</c>
<c.cyan>He never hired an attorney.</c>

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He cooperated fully with</c>
<c.cyan>the entire investigation.</c>

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>But he was a suspect</c>
<c.cyan>for several weeks.</c>

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:45.520 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>However, the injuries inflicted</c>
<c.green>on Jack Koslow were just atrocious.</c>

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.120 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>I don't believe that I've ever seen</c>
<c.green>a case in which a person</c>

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.960 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>was more severely injured and lived.</c>

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>We had another handicap in that</c>
<c.yellow>we kept getting different opinions</c>

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>from the medical people about</c>
<c.yellow>whether his condition,</c>

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>the wounds he had,</c>

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>whether they could have been</c>
<c.yellow>self-inflicted or not.</c>

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The medical examiner's
office indicates

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
that the injuries on
Jack's hands are bite marks,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
presumably caused
by his wife, Caren.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The evidence is stacking
up against Jack Koslow.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>People in Fort Worth</c>
<c.cyan>were pretty convinced</c>

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>that Jack Koslow was</c>
<c.cyan>responsible for this.</c>

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jack was able to get</c>
<c.cyan>out of the hospital</c>

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and attend his wife's funeral.</c>

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The media was there,</c>
<c.cyan>the police were there,</c>

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.040 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and all eyes were on Jack Koslow.</c>

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But the case is about to
take a startling turn

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
when new evidence
changes everything.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The police still were actively</c>
<c.cyan>looking at Jack Koslow</c>

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>when a friend of Jeffrey Dillingham</c>
<c.cyan>said that he had approached him</c>

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and asked to get rid of some bloody</c>
<c.cyan>clothing and a bloody crow bar.</c>

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Then things started to move very</c>
<c.cyan>quickly in a different direction.</c>

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>We ended up talking</c>
<c.yellow>to that witness.</c>

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>We found the physical evidence.</c>

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>We had already talked</c>
<c.yellow>with Kristi Koslow</c>

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>early on in the investigation a</c>
<c.yellow>couple of different times</c>

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>where she had denied knowing</c>
<c.yellow>anything about...</c>
<c.yellow>about anything.</c>

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>It's not that the</c>
<c.green>police found the boys,</c>

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>the boys kind of found</c>
<c.green>the police actually</c>

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>because of their own foolishness.</c>

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The police converge on an Arlington
video store to arrest a bright,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
quiet, hard-working 19-year-old from
the suburbs, Jeffrey Dillingham.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
A kid with a good job,
adoring parents and a fiance

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
he plans to marry that summer.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Dillingham quickly confesses
his role in the attack.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.960 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And he reveals one more thing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
He didn't act alone.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Had not Jeffrey Dillingham been</c>
<c.green>arrested when he was arrested,</c>

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>the arrest of Jack Koslow</c>
<c.green>for the murder of Caren</c>

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>was only a few hours in the future.</c>

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>They fully intended to arrest him.</c>

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>It would've been a terrible</c>
<c.green>miscarriage, of course,</c>

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>for Jack Koslow.</c>

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
With Dillingham's tip, the police
come to round up new suspects,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Brian Salter, and his girlfriend,
Kristi Koslow, Jack's own daughter.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>When these three young people</c>
<c.cyan>were arrested,</c>

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>I know that Jeffrey Dillingham</c>
<c.cyan>confessed to the crime.</c>

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Mr. Dillingham did give
a very detailed

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and graphic confession about
his involvement in the offence.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He named several other people,</c>
<c.yellow>Brian Salter and Kristi Koslow.</c>

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Both of them</c>
<c.yellow>subsequently confessed.</c>

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>The confessions weren't</c>
<c.yellow>all consistent,</c>

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>they were blaming each</c>
<c.yellow>other quite a bit.</c>

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He also laid out</c>
<c.cyan>the plot that involved</c>

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Kristi Koslow and Brian Salter.</c>

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
With three confessions,
the investigation moves into

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
another gear. But for the police
it's about to get stranger still.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In late march, almost two weeks
after the violent attacks

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
on Jack and Caren Koslow, the police
have rounded up three suspects,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Jeffrey Dillingham, Brian Salter,
and Koslow's own daughter,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Kristi Ann.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
All three are jailed
with a $500,000 bail,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
later doubled to a million each

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.440 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
when additional charges of attempted
murder and conspiracy are filed.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.480 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The spotlight then
turns on to Kristi Koslow.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She tried to say all along</c>

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>"Oh, I was just joking.</c>

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>I really didn't mean it".</c>

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>But when she was confronted</c>
<c.yellow>with the fact that she had given</c>

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>the alarm code to Brian Salter,</c>
<c.yellow>she had drawn a map</c>

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>of the interior of the</c>
<c.yellow>house for Brian Salter,</c>

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>then she admitted more or less</c>
<c.yellow>that she knew it wasn't a joke.</c>

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She knew something</c>
<c.yellow>was going to happen.</c>

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Kristi's motive, as bizarre</c>
<c.green>as it sounds, was that</c>

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>by eliminating her dad and her step</c>
<c.green>mum, she would then inherit</c>

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.760 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>the estate and the money</c>
<c.green>that would flow from these things.</c>

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.480 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>So it was an act of greed.</c>

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.600 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Brian Salter and Jeffrey</c>
<c.cyan>Dillingham, before that night,</c>

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.200 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>as far as we knew, were good kids.</c>

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Kristi and Brian had a very</c>
<c.green>uneven relationship.</c>

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Kristi was very dominant</c>
<c.green>in the relationship.</c>

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>So it wasn't that difficult</c>
<c.green>for her to convince Brian</c>

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>to act on her behalf,</c>
<c.green>even to the point of murder.</c>

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.040 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In most cases, there's a boyfriend,
typically a boyfriend who is much

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.080 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
older, who is involved, more
directly involved in the killing.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.000 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But, there's also a very small
number of cases where girls,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.320 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
very, very intelligent, are
more actively involved

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.120 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
in the case and they deny.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She had been talking to Brian</c>
<c.yellow>for a long time about it</c>

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.840 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and then when he</c>
<c.yellow>got serious about it,</c>

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.960 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>that's when he recruited</c>
<c.yellow>Jeffrey Dillingham.</c>

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.160 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Jeffrey was working</c>
<c.green>at Blockbuster Video</c>

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.520 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>at the time that</c>
<c.green>all of this happened.</c>

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.400 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Jeffrey was a huge movie buff.</c>
<c.green>He was somewhat socially awkward</c>

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.320 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>and immature and he</c>
<c.green>lost himself in movies.</c>

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.800 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She supposedly promised</c>
<c.yellow>Jeffrey Dillingham and Brian Salter</c>

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.680 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>a million dollars</c>
<c.yellow>each to commit this crime.</c>

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>And so when Kristi said, "Gee</c>
<c.green>would you like a million dollars?"</c>

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.960 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Well you know that's</c>
<c.green>sounds like a movie plot.</c>

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.200 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>That sounds like that would</c>
<c.green>be interesting.</c>

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.040 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>That's a quick way to</c>
<c.green>make a million dollars.</c>

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
(CAREN SCREAMS)

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.720 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>When this crime took place,</c>
<c.cyan>parents looked at this</c>

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.440 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and just were horrified</c>

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.760 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>that a child could</c>
<c.cyan>do something like this.</c>

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.800 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>It became big news and people</c>
<c.cyan>followed it so closely,</c>

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.040 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>because it was</c>
<c.cyan>everyone's nightmare.</c>

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And suddenly because of</c>
<c.cyan>the foolishness</c>

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.720 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and the crazy talk</c>
<c.cyan>of three kids,</c>

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.120 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>there were three</c>
<c.cyan>families that were destroyed.</c>

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>There were three separate trials.</c>

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Jeffrey Dillingham, my client,</c>
<c.green>was the first of the three</c>

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.160 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>to go to trial. The State</c>
<c.green>had indicted all three</c>

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.640 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>for capital murder and had</c>
<c.green>served notice on all three</c>

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>that the State intended to</c>
<c.green>seek the death penalty.</c>

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Certainly during the</c>
<c.yellow>Dillingham trial,</c>

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>it was made</c>
<c.yellow>to look like Kristi Koslow</c>

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>was the mastermind</c>
<c.yellow>behind it.</c>

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.800 line:70% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>In her trial, the defence</c>

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.160 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>did a good job of trying</c>
<c.yellow>to deflect the blame from her</c>

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and make it seem like she tossed</c>
<c.yellow>out a couple of ideas</c>

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and then Salter and Dillingham</c>
<c.yellow>independently acted on those ideas.</c>

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Jeffrey Dillingham and Brian
Salter planned this murder

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
that Kristi Koslow was never

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
in a meeting with the two of them
when they planned this murder.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She still maintains that</c>

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>she did not mean for</c>
<c.cyan>anyone to take it seriously.</c>

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Dillingham's version of</c>
<c.yellow>the incident during trial</c>

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>was the version that</c>
<c.yellow>he gave to the police,</c>

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>because he did not</c>
<c.yellow>present a defence at trial.</c>

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>And the testimony that the jury</c>
<c.yellow>heard was the testimony</c>

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>that was presented by</c>
<c.yellow>the State of Texas</c>

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>including his detailed confession</c>
<c.yellow>that he gave to the police,</c>

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>which was an audio</c>
<c.yellow>recorded confession.</c>

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Jeffrey Dillingham did</c>
<c.green>not testify in his trial</c>

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>and although he may</c>
<c.green>have expressed remorse</c>

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>in subsequent interviews,</c>
<c.green>for example,</c>

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>nothing official in</c>
<c.green>the court proceedings.</c>

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jeffrey Dillingham actually</c>
<c.cyan>was offered a deal</c>

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>if he would provide evidence</c>
<c.cyan>against Kristi and Brian.</c>

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>When he's offered the plea deal,</c>

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>he thought he would be able</c>
<c.cyan>to get a better deal</c>

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:20.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>if he took his case in his</c>
<c.cyan>defence to a judge and jury.</c>

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And he gambled and he lost.</c>

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Jeffrey Dillingham was</c>

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and has since been</c>
<c.yellow>executed for this crime.</c>

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.920 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>You shall be caused to die by</c>

<c.cyan>sufficient to cause your death.</c>

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.000 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Brian Salter was next up</c>

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.960 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>actually entered a plea</c>

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Brian Salter plead guilty and</c>

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%

<c.yellow>of his life in prison.</c>

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The greatest crime of all,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the killing of your

In June 1994, a Fort
Worth jury finds Kristi Ann Koslow

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
guilty of murder, after
only three hours of deliberation.

Both brain Salter and Kristi

without the possibility
of parole until 2027.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Unlike Jeffrey Dillingham.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>For a variety of reasons,</c>
<c.green>Jeffrey chose to go to trial.</c>

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>I believe that was probably,</c>
<c.green>in large part,</c>

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>due to unrealistic expectations</c>
<c.green>that somehow because of his youth,</c>

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>because of his lack</c>

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>to the extent of</c>
<c.green>imposing the death penalty.</c>

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Kristi Koslow, on the</c>

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And also, the defence did</c>
<c.cyan>a decent job during her trial</c>

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>of distancing her from the</c>
<c.cyan>events that occurred at the home.</c>

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's rare that
children murder for money.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But Kristi Ann Koslow's
case is rarer still.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She was greedy for a fortune
she stood to inherit anyway.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.040 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Angry, or envious, or just plain
impatient, she wanted her money,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.200 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and she wanted it right away,
even if it meant killing to get it.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The puzzling thing for</c>
<c.cyan>me about this case</c>

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:48.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>has always been how three</c>
<c.cyan>seemingly normal young adults,</c>

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>who would not have been</c>
<c.cyan>dangerous and violent on their own,</c>

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>all got together and turned into</c>
<c.cyan>some kind of a murderous monster.</c>

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>I would only add that this</c>
<c.green>case was a terrible tragedy.</c>

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>There are no winners.</c>

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Everybody's a loser in</c>
<c.green>the circumstance such as this.</c>

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>It was a huge, huge</c>

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>loss for that family</c>
<c.green>and for this community.</c>

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>I think she had every</c>
<c.yellow>opportunity in the world</c>

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and chose to take</c>
<c.yellow>what she thought was going to be</c>

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>the easy way out to get</c>
<c.yellow>what she wanted when she wanted it.</c>

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Kristi Koslow is the one who is</c>
<c.yellow>ultimately responsible for this.</c>

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Without her, this would</c>
<c.yellow>have never happened.</c>

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Kristi Ann Koslow mapped
out a murder for profit.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In the early 1970s

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
another young girl is planning a
very different kind of killing.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Her name is Marlene Olive and she's
about to kill her own mother

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
to free herself from
a lifetime of abuse.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Even murder stories can
have a happy beginning.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Jim and Naomi Olive met while</c>
<c.cyan>Jim was in the American military.</c>

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
When Jim's military service ended,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the couple got married and
adopted a child, Marlene Olive.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Marlene Olive was adopted</c>

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>the day after she was born.</c>

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.360 line:63% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The family moved around</c>
<c.cyan>quite a bit.</c>

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She spent like the first 10</c>
<c.cyan>years of her life in Ecuador.</c>

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
For little Marlene, growing up in
Ecuador, life is like a fairy tale.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Until the day she stumbles on
some papers in her father's office,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
papers that spell out what
the ten-year-old never realized.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She's adopted.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.800 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>And it made her terribly angry. She</c>
<c.yellow>said she felt she had been bought.</c>

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.560 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She was angry at her parents,</c>
<c.yellow>at her mother especially.</c>

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.200 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>And her mother was a very</c>
<c.yellow>neurotic person.</c>

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She later said that</c>
<c.cyan>she was confused</c>

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>because she couldn't understand how</c>
<c.cyan>the woman she called mum</c>

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>could be her mother and another</c>
<c.cyan>woman could be her mother as well.</c>

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In 1973, Marlene faces
another disruption,

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.520 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
when her parents decide to
move back to the States.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They buy a little cottage in San
Rafael, just north of San Francisco.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's the perfect place to raise
a family, but not for Marlene.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>When she was about 10 years old, she</c>
<c.cyan>left Ecuador for the United States</c>

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and that was very traumatic</c>
<c.cyan>for her, because although</c>

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>she was an American, she was</c>
<c.cyan>far more comfortable in Spanish</c>

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>than in English.</c>

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She went to school, but she</c>
<c.yellow>was always kind of an outsider.</c>

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>With the conflict with her</c>
<c.yellow>parents she developed ulcers</c>

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and was given</c>
<c.yellow>tranquilizers for these</c>

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and these were something</c>
<c.yellow>that she really enjoyed.</c>

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She walked around school like</c>
<c.yellow>a zombie. She was in rebellion.</c>

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>This was a troubled family.</c>

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
As Marlene becomes a young teen,
the relationship between her

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and her mother gets
worse and worse.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Hey bitch, where's your dad?</c>

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Her mum is unstable,
and Marlene is ashamed.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She tells her friends to
"not pay any attention to her."

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She's "crazy," she's "drunk."

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In the evenings, the adolescent
withdraws into her own little world.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Night after night,
she watches horror films.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She says they'll
help with her English.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
By the spring of 1974,
Marlene is smoking marijuana

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and hanging out with other outsiders,
kids just as lost as she is.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
One of them introduces
her to the occult,

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
witchcraft, and demonology.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.320 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>The relationship between Marlene</c>
<c.green>and her mum and her father</c>

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>is what the case</c>
<c.green>is really all about.</c>

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.680 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>There was a very</c>
<c.green>unhealthy relationship.</c>

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>The mother was schizophrenic,</c>

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.480 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>she used to beat</c>
<c.green>the daughter pretty seriously.</c>

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>As Marlene went into</c>
<c.cyan>the teenage years,</c>

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>teenagers generally</c>
<c.cyan>speaking, a lot of time,</c>

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>have conflict</c>
<c.cyan>with their parents.</c>

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And some of those conflicts</c>

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>were fairly typical</c>
<c.cyan>mother-daughter conflicts.</c>

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.800 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Her issue is with her mother.</c>

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.000 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>It was quite a</c>
<c.yellow>difficult relationship.</c>

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.400 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She had a fairly decent</c>
<c.yellow>relationship with her father.</c>

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>At one point, Naomi stripped naked</c>

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and started gyrating around</c>
<c.cyan>and grabbing her crotch and saying,</c>

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>"This is what your real mother</c>
<c.cyan>was really like. She was a whore.</c>

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>You'll probably be a whore too".</c>

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Get out of here!</c>
<c.yellow>That was a theme that was</c>

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>brought through in the fights</c>
<c.yellow>that she had with her mother.</c>

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>That she was just like her mother.</c>
<c.yellow>Her mother was worthless,</c>

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>her mother was promiscuous,</c>
<c.yellow>and Marlene was just the like.</c>

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>So, it was quite a toxic</c>
<c.yellow>relationship she had</c>

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>with her adoptive mother.</c>

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Because she kind of predicted</c>
<c.cyan>that Marlene was fated</c>

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>to be a prostitute, Marlene</c>
<c.cyan>actually started fantasizing</c>

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>that she would become a hooker</c>
<c.cyan>like her real mum might have been.</c>

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She frequently got into problems.</c>

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She was constantly</c>
<c.green>fighting with the mother</c>

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>whatever the relationship with</c>
<c.green>the father might have been.</c>

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Marlene turns to an unlikely rescuer

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
to take her away from
this troubled family.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Chuck Riley, he always</c>
<c.cyan>had a weight problem.</c>

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Even when he was a small</c>
<c.cyan>kid he had a weight problem</c>

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and other kids made fun of him.</c>

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He dropped out of high school and he</c>
<c.cyan>started stealing and dealing drugs,</c>

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>not so much for the money</c>
<c.cyan>but to impress.</c>

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck was a great big</c>
<c.yellow>overweight guy</c>

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>who wasn't doing</c>
<c.yellow>much with his life either,</c>

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and he had never even had sex.</c>

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>And here was Marlene,</c>

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>intense green eyes,</c>
<c.yellow>and fancied herself a witch.</c>

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She looked at him as</c>
<c.cyan>kind of a protector</c>

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and she accepted a date with him.</c>

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck was so taken with her,</c>
<c.yellow>he even started slimming.</c>

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>And there's no question</c>
<c.green>that Marlene exerted</c>

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>a lot of influence over him and was</c>
<c.green>able to convince him to do things.</c>

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She started stealing, which I think</c>

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>was probably the result of</c>
<c.cyan>her feeling somehow deprived.</c>

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Together, they formed one</c>
<c.yellow>of those intense</c>

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>sort of teenage bonds</c>
<c.yellow>where reality is excluded.</c>

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He thought she was so pretty</c>

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and he was so happy that</c>
<c.cyan>he had her attention.</c>

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And she found that she could</c>
<c.cyan>manipulate him fairly easily.</c>

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.240 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And so, at a certain point,</c>

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>she started talking a lot</c>
<c.cyan>about killing her mother.</c>

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Sometimes killing both parents,</c>
<c.cyan>but usually killing her mother.</c>

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He would try to back away</c>
<c.cyan>from that, but she would say,</c>

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>"Well if you love me you would.</c>

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>You would rescue me from this</c>
<c.cyan>horrible mum that I have".</c>

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She told him "If you</c>
<c.cyan>want me to love you,</c>

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>you're going to have to kill her".</c>

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck had told a friend, "If it has</c>
<c.yellow>to be done, I'd die for Marlene".</c>

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And he may just have to.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
By the spring of 1974,
things have escalated.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Marlene, who was adopted,</c>
<c.green>felt very oppressed</c>

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.480 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>by this situation she was in there</c>

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>and felt the only way she</c>
<c.green>could get out of it</c>

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>was to get rid</c>
<c.green>of the mother.</c>

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The day Jim and Naomi Olive</c>
<c.cyan>were murdered, Marlene Olive</c>

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>made sure that she was out</c>
<c.cyan>shopping with her father Jim Olive.</c>

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.760 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She didn't want him killed.</c>

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She wanted her mother killed.</c>

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck was fascinated with</c>
<c.yellow>fast cars and guns.</c>

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:11.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>And, one day, Marlene phones him</c>
<c.yellow>and says, "Get the gun."</c>

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He didn't want to use the pistol</c>
<c.cyan>unless he thought he had to,</c>

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>because he didn't want</c>
<c.cyan>to make the noise.</c>

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He went over there with a</c>
<c.cyan>pistol and a claw hammer.</c>

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck turns up and the family</c>
<c.yellow>green Vega car is in the driveway.</c>

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>So, Marlene waves him away. 'Go on',</c>
<c.yellow>you know. 'Don't come in now'.</c>

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He hides around the corner.</c>
<c.yellow>Marlene and her father</c>

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>leave the house in the car,</c>
<c.yellow>Chuck goes in through the door.</c>

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene has left</c>
<c.yellow>the door open for him.</c>

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Goes down the hall.</c>

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He finds Naomi in her</c>
<c.yellow>customary condition,</c>

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>she's always sort of been on pills,</c>
<c.yellow>she's dozing in the bedroom.</c>

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
What, what are you doing?

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:08.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And he hit Naomi Olive repeatedly</c>
<c.cyan>in the head with that claw hammer.</c>

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Worse, the hammer lodges in</c>
<c.yellow>the forehead, he can't get it out.</c>

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>This is going to be the</c>
<c.yellow>subject of nightmares for him</c>

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.160 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>for a long time to come.</c>

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He was having a hard time killing</c>
<c.cyan>her and he ran to the kitchen.</c>

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>He grabbed a steak</c>
<c.cyan>knife and he started stabbing her.</c>

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She was still fighting and he</c>
<c.cyan>put a pillow over her head.</c>

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Then Chuck hears the car returning.</c>

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He panics.</c>
<c.yellow>He doesn't know where to hide.</c>

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The plan that Chuck and Marlene

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
had so carefully orchestrated
is about to run off the rails.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It's the spring of 1974,

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and Marlene Olive has convinced
her boyfriend to kill her mother.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.840 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They've planned it all out.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
But her father comes home early,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and interrupts
the murder in progress.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:29.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Jim Olive comes in looking for</c>
<c.yellow>his wife, finds her in the bedroom,</c>

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and then he realises that</c>
<c.yellow>the assailant must still be there</c>

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>because they haven't been away</c>
<c.yellow>very long. He grabs up a knife,</c>

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>sees Chuck Riley hiding,</c>
<c.yellow>and advances on him with a knife.</c>

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.960 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>"I'll kill you, you</c>
<c.yellow>bastard", he says.</c>

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.320 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And he went to attack Chuck,</c>
<c.cyan>who then shot him.</c>

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck has the gun with him</c>
<c.yellow>in a paper bag.</c>

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:59.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He pulls it out and fires</c>
<c.yellow>the gun from inside the paper bag.</c>

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Four shots. The pattern of</c>
<c.yellow>the bullet is very close.</c>

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.640 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Chuck was kind of proud of</c>
<c.yellow>this afterwards, as marksman.</c>

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Marlene Olive, though she didn't</c>
<c.cyan>want her father killed,</c>

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>she didn't panic or immediately get</c>
<c.cyan>upset because he was killed.</c>

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>This is the situation that</c>
<c.yellow>young murderers rarely prepare for.</c>

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>It is a difficult problem</c>

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>because bodies are much harder to</c>
<c.yellow>get rid of than teenagers realize.</c>

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene is the organizer. She is</c>
<c.yellow>quite a bit younger than Chuck,</c>

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>but she is the one in charge here.</c>
<c.yellow>Marlene the witch.</c>

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>You don't need to worry</c>
<c.green>about anything,</c>

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>I'll clean up the mess and...</c>

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She decides that they're going</c>
<c.yellow>to try to get rid of the blood.</c>

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.600 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Very difficult, lot of blood.</c>

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>They even scrub the bedroom,</c>
<c.yellow>scrub the walls.</c>

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The two of them wrapped</c>
<c.cyan>those corpses up in some rugs.</c>

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Then Chuck says, "where are</c>
<c.yellow>we going to put them?"</c>

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.720 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and Marlene says the China Camp.</c>

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>The China Camp was a sort of</c>
<c.yellow>mystical kind of place</c>

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.120 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>where teenagers</c>
<c.yellow>went for barbecues and drugs.</c>

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And they soaked them with</c>
<c.cyan>gasoline and burned the corpses.</c>

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.480 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene showed very little remorse.</c>

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.880 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene went about her day. She had</c>
<c.yellow>sex with her boyfriend right after.</c>

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.800 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>So in a sense, she was manipulating</c>
<c.yellow>him even after the event.</c>

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.760 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>So she kept him close</c>
<c.yellow>through the manipulation</c>

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.520 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>of a sexual relationship.</c>

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.320 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>There's something very</c>
<c.yellow>conniving about Marlene.</c>

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:13.120 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene strikes me as a very,</c>
<c.yellow>very troubled young woman.</c>

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
It seems as if Marlene and Chuck
together have gotten away

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.120 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
with a grisly double murder.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>An early morning hunter</c>
<c.yellow>spots the smoke</c>

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and phones the Fire Department</c>
<c.yellow>thinking it's a brush fire.</c>

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Two firemen come out</c>
<c.yellow>and conclude, looking at the bones,</c>

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>that somebody was burning a deer.</c>

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>They go back to the station,</c>
<c.yellow>report it's nothing much,</c>

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>just a deer being burned, then</c>
<c.yellow>one of the other firemen says,</c>

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.560 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>"Not likely, more likely a body".</c>

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>But they don't do anything about</c>
<c.yellow>it. They don't go back and look.</c>

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>They just leave things.</c>

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>It's actually a week before</c>
<c.yellow>the murder is discovered.</c>

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>A few days after the murders,</c>

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:10.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>a business associate of Jim Olive</c>
<c.cyan>wondered how come Jim had not</c>

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>come into work or even called in to</c>
<c.cyan>say why he hadn't come into work.</c>

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>He finally, after a week,</c>
<c.yellow>comes around to the house,</c>

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>looks in the window,</c>
<c.yellow>sees all the disarray,</c>

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.000 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>and phones the police.</c>

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>I feel I probably should have</c>
<c.cyan>contacted you already</c>

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>about Jim Olive,</c>
<c.cyan>he's been missing for about a week.</c>

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>I just went by his house, I</c>
<c.cyan>was given the address.</c>

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Looks like the place</c>
<c.cyan>has been disturbed.</c>

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>I appreciate your help.</c>

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
That evening, an officer shows up
at the Olive home on Hibiscus Way.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The policeman finds Marlene alone,
and asks her

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
to come down to the station with
him to answer a few questions.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.760 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The police come over and they</c>
<c.cyan>find the house in disarray but they</c>

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.920 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>don't find any blood or anything</c>
<c.cyan>that really indicates foul play.</c>

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.000 line:20% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Marlene had stories for them</c>

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.520 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>but of course none of them really</c>
<c.green>made a lot sense.</c>

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And she said, "My parents have taken</c>
<c.cyan>a brief vacation to Lake Tahoe".</c>

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>OK, but the cops found something</c>
<c.cyan>fishy about the story.</c>

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.040 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And they started</c>
<c.cyan>questioning her closely.</c>

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.920 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Totally fine.</c>

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene's story is,</c>
<c.yellow>that she was away</c>

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>at Lake Tahoe camping.</c>

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>"Oh, what was the weather like?"</c>

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.640 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>"Oh, it was fine."</c>

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Oh, she didn't know that there</c>
<c.yellow>had been a snowstorm</c>

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>in Lake Tahoe</c>
<c.yellow>that weekend.</c>

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.200 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Then the stories
get stranger still...

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.880 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She said that she'd dreamed</c>
<c.yellow>that she saw her father</c>

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.480 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>standing over her mother who</c>
<c.yellow>was in a pool of blood.</c>

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.400 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>She tells other stories,</c>
<c.yellow>none of them very credible.</c>

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.920 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Alarmed by Marlene's
strange account,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Detective Bart Stinson,
decides to have her admitted

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
to Marin general hospital for
psychiatric evaluation.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
In the meantime,
he goes back to 353 Hibiscus Way.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Inspecting each of the rooms,
he notices that one of them

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
has been thoroughly
cleaned and scrubbed.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Then on the carpet,
he spots some tiny red particles.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:24.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Stinson has enough experience to
recognize it's coagulated blood.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:30.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Back at the station, Marlene, now
diagnosed sane, is questioned again.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.800 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She changed her story and she said,</c>

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.720 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>"My father killed my</c>
<c.cyan>mother and then fled".</c>

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And then she said, "No my mother</c>
<c.cyan>killed my father and then fled".</c>

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The police also talk to one of
Marlene's friends, Deanna Krieger.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.440 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Deanna too has a
strange tale to tell.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
About a week earlier,
Marlene had asked her to come by

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.520 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
to help clean the house.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
There was blood all over the place.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
And when they finished, she, Marlene,
and Chuck Riley made love together,

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
right in Marlene's mother's bed.
<c.yellow>Where did this blood come from?</c>

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.000 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Marlene just has a way of
making you do things, she says.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The police decide they need to
talk with Marlene one more time.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.080 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>And then finally she told the truth</c>

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and she led them to that pit where</c>
<c.cyan>the burned bodies were discovered.</c>

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She tried to justify what happened</c>

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>based on the way she was treated in</c>
<c.green>the relationship with the mother.</c>

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.240 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She told the whole story and she</c>
<c.cyan>told that her older boyfriend</c>

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Chuck Riley had actually</c>
<c.cyan>committed the murders first hand.</c>

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.720 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>We've seen this again around</c>
<c.yellow>the world that girls and women</c>

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.320 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>have manipulated boys and men</c>
<c.yellow>to do the dirty work for them.</c>

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.840 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>But they're still as guilty as</c>
<c.yellow>their partner for the event.</c>

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.040 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Get your hands off of me.</c>

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.680 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Get your hands of me</c>
The double murder in Marin country

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.040 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
hits the national headlines.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.440 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The press dub it the BBQ Murders.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Court is now in session.</c>

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
They were tried separately.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.080 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Chuck was tried in adult court
and got death,

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.560 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
and reduced to life in prison,
and he's still there.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>The Jury has found</c>
<c.cyan>him guilty as charged.</c>

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.760 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
The jury comes down
hard on Chuck Riley.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.200 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
Marlene fares much better.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.600 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>I was afraid that the person who</c>
<c.cyan>killed them would come after me.</c>

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.880 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She originally was a juvenile.</c>

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.320 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>I had nothing to do with it.</c>

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She plead guilty as a juvenile
which meant that

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.320 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the maximum sentence she could be
given was less than four years.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.880 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>Had she been an adult</c>
<c.green>she would still be in prison.</c>

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.280 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She was going to be released in
just a few weeks when she escaped.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.480 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
She made her way to New
York and she fulfilled

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.400 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
the prophecy of her adoptive mother
by becoming a prostitute.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.680 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>I know she got into some trouble.</c>

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.360 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She went to Southern California.</c>

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.280 line:83% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>She got in some trouble there.</c>

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.360 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>There were allegations</c>
<c.green>of prostitution.</c>

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.840 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.green>And she got jailed and I kind of</c>
<c.green>lost track of her at that point.</c>

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.160 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>Marlene, from what I can discover,</c>
<c.yellow>there's no news that</c>

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.800 line:77% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.yellow>she's made a new start. And Chuck,</c>
<c.yellow>well, Chuck is still in prison.</c>

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.360 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>She visited Chuck</c>
<c.cyan>one time in 1980</c>

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.560 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>and it was a kind of an awkward</c>
<c.cyan>reunion at the prison.</c>

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>Chuck said to somebody</c>
<c.cyan>after she left,</c>

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.840 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
<c.cyan>"I'll never hear from her</c>
<c.cyan>again", and he never has.</c>

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.480 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
What teenage boy doesn't dream
of saving a beautiful young lady?

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.240 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
What they don't tell you is that

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.640 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
sometimes the hero ends up replacing
the lady in the dungeon... forever.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.680 line:13% align:middle position:50% size:80%
